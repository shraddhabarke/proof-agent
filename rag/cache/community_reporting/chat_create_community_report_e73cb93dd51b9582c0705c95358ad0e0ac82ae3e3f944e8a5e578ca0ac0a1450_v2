This unique set composition makes TWO a distinct entity within the framework of F*, showcasing its structure by including both the concept of nothingness and singularity as its foundational elements.\",5\n331,ZERO,\"ZERO is a concept represented in F*, where it primarily denotes a set defined as having no elements, effectively making it the empty set. This is characterized by utilizing the empty type False, aligning with the mathematical definition of an empty set. Additionally, ZERO is described as a type in F* that represents the set containing only the number 0. To reconcile these descriptions into a coherent summary, ZERO in F* can be understood in two contexts: firstly, as the empty set with no elements, and secondarily, as a type representing a set that specifically contains the single element, the number 0. This dual representation allows ZERO to be utilized in F* programming both as a concept of emptiness and as a specific numeric set, depending on the context.\",6\n470,SET,\"SET is a concept prevalent in both mathematics and computer science, characterized by the collection of members into a cohesive whole. This concept is defined through set comprehension, which outlines a set in terms of a predicate over its elements, ensuring each member meets specific criteria to be included. Additionally, SET serves as a construct in type theory, where it is utilized to define collections of elements that possess particular properties, highlighting its importance in structuring and organizing data according to defined characteristics. Furthermore, in the context of F*, SET plays a crucial role in demonstrating the encoding of Russell's Paradox. This paradox showcases a set that exists in the base universe, despite its constructor being of a higher universe level, illustrating the complex and foundational nature of sets in understanding and resolving fundamental paradoxes in theoretical computer science and mathematics.\",6\n472,ONE,\"ONE is a set defined in F*, characterized as a singleton set.

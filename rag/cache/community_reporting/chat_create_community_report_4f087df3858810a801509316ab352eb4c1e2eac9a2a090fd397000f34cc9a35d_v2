Initially characterized as a squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous old sinner, hard and sharp as flint, with a cold demeanor that affects his physical appearance and social interactions, he is solitary, unapproachable, and miserly, showing little to no warmth or human sympathy. Scrooge's frugality, lack of compassion, and solitary figure are marked by his business partnership with Marley and his initial skepticism and fear of the supernatural events occurring around him. Despite his initial disapproval of Christmas festivities and lack of interest in the happiness or well-being of others, including his own family and employees, Scrooge undergoes a profound transformation over the course of Christmas Eve night.\n\nThis transformation is initiated by the visit of the ghost of his former business partner, Jacob Marley, and the subsequent visitations from spirits showing him past, present, and future events to reflect on his life choices and attitudes towards wealth and happiness. These spirits, including the Ghost of Christmas Past, challenge his perspectives and encourage a profound experience of redemption. Scrooge is tormented by scenes that reflect on the consequences of his actions and the nature of death, including contemplating a covered body and conversing with a Phantom. He is shown various scenes by the Ghost to learn about the spirit of Christmas, reflecting on past Christmases and his experiences, showing a transformation in his attitude towards Christmas and life.\n\nScrooge's journey is marked by moments of reflection on his past with both joy and sorrow, expressing regret for not being more generous, and showing curiosity about the Spirit's actions and the impact of those actions on Christmas Day. He is deeply affected by the visit of Marley's Ghost, showing fear and curiosity about the warnings of future hauntings, and is particularly concerned about Tiny Tim's health and future upon hearing the Ghost's prophecy. His transformation is significant, as he becomes generous and fatherly towards Tiny Tim and a better man overall, vowing to honor Christmas and improve himself. Scrooge's change of heart is evident as he shows generosity and a desire to connect with others, including his nephew Fred and his employee Bob Cratchit, ultimately reflecting on his life and relationships during the Christmas season with a newfound appreciation for the festive season and compassion for the poor and destitute.\",71\n19,MARLEY,\"Marley, a significant figure in the life of Scrooge, is introduced as a deceased character, having been dead for seven years at the beginning of the story.

His presence is so impactful that Scrooge recalls Marley's face, which even appears on the tiles in Scrooge's fireplace, underscoring the profound influence Marley had on Scrooge's life.

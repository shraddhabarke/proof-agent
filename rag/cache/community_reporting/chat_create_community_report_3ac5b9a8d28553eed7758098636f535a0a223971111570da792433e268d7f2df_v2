It serves as a simple state monad used to structure interpreters by facilitating state-passing functions, thereby allowing state to be passed and transformed through these functions. ST represents stateful computations that can handle integer states, and it enables the construction of larger stateful computations from smaller ones using return and bind operations. This design allows for the efficient management and transformation of state within programs, making ST a crucial tool for developers working with stateful computations in F*.\",8\n531,BIND,\"BIND is a combinator in the F* programming language, designed to sequence stateful computations. It serves as a predefined action in computational models, representing the process of binding the result of one computation to another. This function allows for the chaining of operations on its result by applying a function to the outcome of another function. Through this mechanism, BIND facilitates the orderly execution of multiple computations, where the output of one function becomes the input for the next, ensuring a smooth and logical flow of data through the program's logic.\",9\n698,PART2.ST,,4\n690,OPTION MONAD,\"Option monad is a monadic structure used to model computations that may fail or return a value, providing a way to chain such computations\",2\n533,BIND_BUGGY,BIND_BUGGY is an incorrect implementation of BIND in F* that re-uses old state,1\n704,ASSOC,\"ASSOC refers to a lemma that is focused on proving the associativity monad law within a computational model. This law asserts that the order in which bind operations are applied does not impact the outcome.

This law states that binding a return value to a function is equivalent to just applying the function directly. It highlights the right identity property of the bind operation in computational models, emphasizing the fundamental principle that the operation of binding a monadic return value to a function yields the same result as applying the function to the input directly.

Beyond its functional role in F*, a lemma is also understood as a preliminary proposition or statement of proof within the broader scope of mathematical and logical arguments. It serves as a foundational step in the construction of more complex proofs, acting as a proposition or statement that, while often requiring proof itself, facilitates the establishment of a larger theorem.\n\nMoreover, LEMMA is described as a syntactic shorthand in F*, specifically designed for specifying proofs. This designation highlights its role as an instance of the Hoare-style refinement of pure computations, which further illustrates its integral function in the formulation and verification of proofs within the F* programming language.

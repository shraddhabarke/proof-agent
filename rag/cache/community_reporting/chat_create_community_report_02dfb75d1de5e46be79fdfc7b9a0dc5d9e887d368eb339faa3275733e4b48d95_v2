Specifically, within the domain of F* and its lambda calculus, VAR represents a variable within a term, utilizing de Bruijn indices for its representation. This method is chosen to avoid naming conflicts that can arise in complex computational expressions and environments. The use of de Bruijn indices is a notable practice in the Simply Typed Lambda Calculus (STLC), where VAR is crucial for referring to variables both within expressions and typing environments.

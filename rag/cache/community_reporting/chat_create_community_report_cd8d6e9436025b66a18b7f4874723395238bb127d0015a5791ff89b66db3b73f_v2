It represents an evolution from its predecessor, Steel, by introducing a core logic named PulseCore, which is tailored for mutable state and concurrency. Pulse operates as both a programming language with imperative syntax and a framework, enabling developers to write specifications and functions that manipulate mutable references safely. It employs Concurrent Separation Logic for specifications and proofs, focusing on program verification through constructs like the \"\"points-to\"\" predicate, the separating conjunction \"\"**\"\", and support for partial commutative monoids, which are crucial for reasoning about concurrent programs.\n\nPulse provides a rich set of features for software verification and development. It includes a checker that automates boilerplate ghost lemmas and requires specific permissions on references to ensure safe memory manipulation. This checker is part of Pulse's broader aim to automate memory safety in a programming context, particularly through the use of separation logic. The framework supports the creation of new threads, programming concurrency, and includes primitives for atomic operations and invariants, which are essential for proving properties of concurrent programs.\n\nAs a programming platform, Pulse implements the Boyer-Moore majority vote algorithm and supports extraction to OCaml, C, and Rust, making it versatile for various software development needs. It introduces innovative concepts such as ghost computations and ghost state, alongside primitives for programming and proving properties in F*. Pulse allows for the definition of custom predicates and recursive ghost functions for data structures like lists, enhancing its capability for handling complex data structures and algorithms.\n\nPulse emphasizes explicit control over memory management, akin to languages like C or Rust, but with a unique focus on proof-oriented programming. It supports mutable references for memory allocation and reclamation, and provides functionalities for working with mutable arrays, including operations for reading and writing to arrays, managing permissions, and memory. The language is designed for partial correctness, ensuring state satisfaction if programs return, even allowing programs to loop indefinitely.\n\nThe environment Pulse offers is conducive to interactive development and proof of programs, focusing on verifying the correctness of programs through a typing environment and a separation logic context. It treats functions as first-class citizens, supporting general recursion and allowing functions to be passed to other functions, returned as results, and stored in the heap. Pulse also uses existential quantification as part of its separation logic syntax for writing specifications, illustrating its comprehensive approach to software verification.\n\nPulse is accessible

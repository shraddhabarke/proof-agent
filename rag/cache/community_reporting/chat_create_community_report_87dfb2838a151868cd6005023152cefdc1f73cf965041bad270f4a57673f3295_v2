It serves as a simple state monad used to structure interpreters by facilitating state-passing functions, thereby allowing state to be passed and transformed through these functions. ST represents stateful computations that can handle integer states, and it enables the construction of larger stateful computations from smaller ones using return and bind operations. This design allows for the efficient management and transformation of state within programs, making ST a crucial tool for developers working with stateful computations in F*.\",8\n531,BIND,\"BIND is a combinator in the F* programming language, designed to sequence stateful computations. It serves as a predefined action in computational models, representing the process of binding the result of one computation to another.

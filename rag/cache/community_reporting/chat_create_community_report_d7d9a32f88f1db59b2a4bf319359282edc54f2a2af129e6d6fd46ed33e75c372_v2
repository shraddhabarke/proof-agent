It plays a crucial role in the realm of formal verification within computer science, where it is employed to prove lemmas, solve quantifiers, and check the satisfiability of logical formulas over one or more theories. Z3 distinguishes itself by handling a wide array of logical formulas, including those with quantified formulas and skolemization, thereby proving the assumptions and assertions provided to it.\n\nThis solver is integral to the functioning of F*, a programming language designed for program verification, where it is used to discharge goals automatically, verify assertions in programs, and prove verification conditions. Z3's integration with F* is particularly notable for its ability to automatically instantiate lemmas, such as through the SMTPat annotation for automatic lemma instantiation, and for proving the correctness of programs by checking computed weakest preconditions. It also assists in the verification of proofs, solving queries, and discharging trivial goals, such as trivial equalities, within Meta-F*.\n\nMoreover, Z3 supports a built-in theory of datatypes, enhancing its versatility, although this feature is not utilized by F* for its datatype encoding. The solver's ability to automatically handle simple proof obligations, with the assistance of tactics for more complex proofs, underscores its adaptability and efficiency in various verification scenarios.\n\nIn summary, Z3 stands out as an essential tool in the verification of logical formulas, program correctness, and the automatic handling of proof obligations, making it a cornerstone in the field of computer science for researchers and developers alike.\",21\n918,SMTENCODING,The process of encoding logical formulas and queries into the SMT (Satisfiability Modulo Theories) format for processing by tools like Z3,2\n930,CONTEXT POLLUTION,,2\n937,SMTPAT ANNOTATION,\"SMTPat annotation is used in F* to allow Z3 to instantiate lemmas automatically, demonstrating an integration of F* with automated theorem proving via SMT solvers.\",2\n18,ASSERTION,A statement in F* that is checked by the compiler to verify if a proposition is valid before program execution,1\n678,SMTPAT,\"An annotation in F* that instructs the theorem prover Z3 to automatically instantiate certain lemmas, facilitating the process of formal verification\",1\n916,SMTENCODING._TEST_QUERY_STATS,,1\n924,ALEXOPAQUE.FIND_ABOVE_FOR_G,\"A query event where Z3 succeeded in finding a solution in 46 milliseconds, demonstrating the effectiveness of revealing opaque definitions selectively.\",1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n1332,SMT2 THEORY,Z3,SMT2 theories are checked for satisfiability using the Z3 solver,23\n1391,Z3,SMTENCODING,\"Z3 processes .smt2 files, which are a result of SMTEncoding, to provide quantifier instance profiles\",23\n1406,Z3,CONTEXT POLLUTION,The efficiency of Z3 in finding proofs is affected by Context Pollution within F*,23\n1425,SMTPAT ANNOTATION,Z3,The SMTPat annotation in F* specifically relates to the use of the Z3 SMT solver for lemma instantiation.,23\n16,ASSERTION,Z3,Assertions in F* are verified using the Z3 SMT solver,22\n984,Z3,SMTPAT,\"The SMTPat annotation is specifically designed to work with Z3, guiding the theorem prover in the automatic instantiation of lemmas in F*\",22\n1384,Z3,SMTENCODING._TEST_QUERY_STATS,The event SMTEncoding._test_query_stats was successfully verified by Z3,22\n1398,Z3,ALEXOPAQUE.FIND_ABOVE_FOR_G,The event demonstrates Z3's capability to solve problems efficiently when opaque definitions are selectively revealed.,22\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.

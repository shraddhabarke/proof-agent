It is designed to ensure well-typed terms through its indexing structure, representing various data types and operations within its syntax. STLC is characterized by its abstract syntax and typing rules, which facilitate the description of computation through function abstraction and application. This system employs variable binding and substitution as its core mechanisms, allowing for the expression of computation in a structured and logical manner. By using typed variables, STLC provides a robust framework for defining and applying functions, making it an essential concept in the study of mathematical logic and computer science.\",19\n163,COQ,\"Coq is a dependently typed programming language and proof assistant that emphasizes the importance of function termination to ensure the soundness of its type theory. It disallows general-purpose programming language interpreters due to their potential to loop indefinitely, highlighting its focus on termination. Coq features a universe system that is distinct from F*'s, bearing more similarity to those found in Agda and Lean, as described by Adam Chlipala. This system plays a crucial role in structuring both proofs and programming within Coq.\n\nAs a proof assistant, Coq is renowned for its ability to facilitate the development and verification of formal proofs. It supports explicit proof writing, akin to what is found in Meta-F* and Lean, and enables tactics and metaprogramming, which are essential for creating complex mathematical proofs. Coq's approach to proof assistance is comprehensive, offering tutorials on typeclasses, which are used to structure proofs and programming effectively.\n\nMoreover, Coq imposes specific restrictions on its Prop type to prevent unsoundness, a measure similar to F*'s handling of proof irrelevance and squash types. These restrictions underscore Coq's commitment to maintaining a robust and sound framework for formal verification.\n\nIn summary, Coq stands out as a proof assistant and programming language that prioritizes soundness through function termination, employs a sophisticated universe system akin to Agda's and Lean's, and supports a wide range of features for proof development, including tactics, metaprogramming, and typeclasses. Its comprehensive approach to programming language semantics and formal proofs, as well as its educational resources, make it a valuable tool for those involved in formal verification and proof development.\",10\n420,TYP,,2\n283,ARROW,A function type in STLC representing functions from one type to another,1\n284,TT,\"TT represents the boolean constant true in Simply Typed Lambda Calculus (STLC), indicating a term of type Bool.

It defines fundamental types and operations that are essential for the language's functionality, including logical negation, universal quantification, and the type 'prop' for proof-irrelevant propositions. PRIMS includes basic definitions and is a critical dependency for other modules within the F* ecosystem. It showcases F*'s capabilities for inductive types and functional programming by defining basic types like list and introducing predefined constructs such as dtuple2 for dependent pairs. Additionally, PRIMS provides foundational types and functions, including those necessary for quantification, logical connectives, and the signature for polymorphic decidable equality. It also includes primitive definitions and operations, emphasizing its role in defining ambient primitive definitions for every F* program. As the very first module in every F* program's dependence graph, PRIMS defines essential elements like the equals type and squashed equality proofs, alongside the type of natural numbers and other boolean refinement types.

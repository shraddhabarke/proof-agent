It is specifically designed to handle a subset of F* language programs, facilitating the integration of formally proven components without incurring runtime overhead. This capability extends to Pulse programs, which can also be extracted and executed within the C environment. The language is noted for its efficiency and its ability to avoid overflow in arithmetic operations, making it a suitable choice for executing formally verified code.\n\nIn addition to its role as a compilation target, C encompasses a specific module or component that is adept at managing cancellable invariants. This includes the encapsulation of next and destroy functions, along with maintaining an invariant for the heap reference x. This aspect of C highlights its utility in dealing with complex programming constructs, ensuring the creation, sharing, and cancellation of invariants are handled efficiently.\n\nOverall, C represents a critical bridge between high-level, formally verified programming in F* and Pulse, and low-level, efficient execution.

This purity is a cornerstone of functional programming, offering benefits in terms of predictability, testability, and parallelizability. The semantics of these pure programs are inherited from OCaml when compiled to it, indicating a close relationship between F* and OCaml's call-by-value evaluation strategy. This relationship underscores the importance of understanding OCaml's semantics to effectively utilize F* for pure programming.

It pertains to the strategy used to evaluate function calls, which is especially relevant for pure functions where the order of evaluation does not affect the outcome. However, the choice of evaluation strategy can significantly impact the performance and correctness of programs. This is evident in the relationship between evaluation order and pure programs, as well as the implementation of different evaluation strategies by abstract machines. The evaluation order's relevance is further highlighted by its influence on extensional type theory, suggesting that it may affect termination properties of pure functions in F*.

These machines are essential for understanding how F* programs are executed and how different evaluation strategies can influence the overall behavior of a program. The relationship between abstract machines and the evaluation order of pure terms highlights the machines' importance in the practical application of F* programming concepts.

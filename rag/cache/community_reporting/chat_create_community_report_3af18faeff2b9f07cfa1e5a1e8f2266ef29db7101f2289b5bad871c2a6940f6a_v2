It serves various purposes, including the demonstration of mutual recursion in programming languages like F*, where it is specifically employed for storing integers at each internal node. Beyond its conventional use, the tree data structure has been enhanced to represent computations, supporting non-deterministic choice and concurrency. This is achieved by interleaving actions from several threads, thereby facilitating the modeling of complex computational processes. Additionally, trees are defined generically for effectful actions in the realm of computation, with nodes in the structure representing either a return value or an action with continuations.

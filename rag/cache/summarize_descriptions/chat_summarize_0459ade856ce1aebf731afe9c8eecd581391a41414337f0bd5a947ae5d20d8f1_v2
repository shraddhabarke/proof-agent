This tactic operates by potentially introducing the lemma's precondition as a separate goal. This means that when POSE_LEMMA is applied, it not only incorporates the postcondition of a lemma into the current context but also presents any precondition of the lemma as a distinct goal that needs to be addressed. This approach facilitates the structured application of lemmas within proofs, ensuring that both the conditions for applying a lemma and its consequences are properly handled within the F* proof environment.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1742951730, "model": "gpt-4-0125-preview", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 118, "prompt_tokens": 180, "total_tokens": 298, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.

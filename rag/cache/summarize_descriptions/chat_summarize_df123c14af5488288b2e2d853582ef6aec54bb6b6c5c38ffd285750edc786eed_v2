It is designed for program verification, formal reasoning, and theorem proving, making it a powerful tool for writing mathematical proofs and software specifications. As a proof assistant, FSTAR facilitates the development of formal proofs of correctness for programs, allowing users to verify software properties and ensure the reliability of their code. The language is used for formalizing and proving properties of programs, and it supports writing programs with formal specifications. FSTAR is particularly useful in computational contexts, such as memory management and region liveness, where precise verification is crucial.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1747795733, "model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ee1d74bde0", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 135, "prompt_tokens": 659, "total_tokens": 794, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.

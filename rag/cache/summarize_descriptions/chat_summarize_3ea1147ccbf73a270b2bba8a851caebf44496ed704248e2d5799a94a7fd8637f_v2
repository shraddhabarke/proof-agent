This includes a notation similar to OCaml for types that fit certain restrictions, as well as the support for several kinds of polymorphic types. F* is designed to compile programs into OCaml for execution, highlighting the practical utility of its verification capabilities. This compilation process allows F* functionalities to be utilized within OCaml's programming environment, particularly by adopting OCaml's call-by-value semantics for pure terms. Moreover, F* can extract verified programs into OCaml, enabling the use of formally proven components in larger systems. This feature showcases the direct relationship between the language and its compilation target, with F* code being compiled to OCaml to leverage these benefits. Additionally, F* inherits OCaml's syntax for defining functions and lambda terms, further emphasizing the deep connection between the two languages. Through this integration, F* programs can be compiled into OCaml code for execution, ensuring that F* compiles pure programs to OCaml, thus adopting its call-by-value semantics for these terms. This comprehensive approach allows for a seamless interaction between F* and OCaml, making it possible for developers to benefit from the strengths of both languages in their projects.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1742951744, "model": "gpt-4-0125-preview", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 258, "prompt_tokens": 392, "total_tokens": 650, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.

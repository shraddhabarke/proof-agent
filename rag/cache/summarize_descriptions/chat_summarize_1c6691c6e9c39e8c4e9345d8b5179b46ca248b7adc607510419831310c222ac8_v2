They have been discussed and used as a case study in F*, highlighting their significance in representing data securely and efficiently. Merkle trees support incremental updates and are optimized for various workloads, including those involving sparse trees. Furthermore, they can be implemented using mutable structures, which adds to their flexibility and utility in different applications.

It plays a crucial role in the construction of proofs within the language, specifically by allowing the building of a proof of one proposition from a proof of another. This is achieved through the utilization of squashed proofs, which are a type of proof used in F* to ensure the irrelevance of certain proof details in the verification process. BIND_SQUASH ensures the proof-irrelevance of squash types, maintaining the integrity and simplicity of proofs by focusing only on the essential aspects required for verification. This function is instrumental in streamlining the proof construction process in F*, making it more efficient and manageable.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1742951718, "model": "gpt-4-0125-preview", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 144, "prompt_tokens": 193, "total_tokens": 337, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.

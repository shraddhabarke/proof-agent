It is used to describe pure, total functions in F*'s logical core, ensuring that computations are guaranteed to terminate and remain total. This label indicates that a function has no side effects, meaning that the only outcome of the computation is the value it returns. As a part of F*'s effect system, TOT is retained during compilation and can influence runtime behavior, highlighting its significance in the compilation process. Essentially, TOT embodies computations that are both pure and always terminate, underscoring its role in denoting computations that are free from side effects and are ensured to reach a conclusion, thereby influencing the runtime behavior without introducing unpredictability.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1742951693, "model": "gpt-4-0125-preview", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 159, "prompt_tokens": 281, "total_tokens": 440, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.

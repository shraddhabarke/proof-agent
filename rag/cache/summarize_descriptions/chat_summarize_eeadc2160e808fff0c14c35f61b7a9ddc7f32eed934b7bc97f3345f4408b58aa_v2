It is an effect that represents total correctness, denoting computations that are guaranteed to always terminate and produce a result for any given input without causing side effects. This characteristic of TOT makes it foundational in the F* language, serving as a base for other effects such as PURE, GHOST, and DIV. Essentially, TOT is utilized for substituting a variable with a term, embodying a type or effect that underscores the assurance of total (always terminating) computations. This effect is crucial for indicating a total function within the language, reinforcing the language's capability to handle computations with guaranteed outcomes and no unintended consequences.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1742951700, "model": "gpt-4-0125-preview", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 144, "prompt_tokens": 221, "total_tokens": 365, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.

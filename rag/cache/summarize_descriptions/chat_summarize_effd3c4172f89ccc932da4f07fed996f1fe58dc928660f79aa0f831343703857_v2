It is designed to include pervasive definitions and functions essential for the F* programming language, serving as an interface that developers interact with. This module encompasses the full list of normalization steps and other basic operations critical for programming in F*. Additionally, FSTAR.PERVASIVES is notable for offering primitives for explicit type coercion, which are based on equality proofs. These features are part of its functionality to enhance the programming experience by providing essential tools and operations within the F* environment.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1742951679, "model": "gpt-4-0125-preview", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 117, "prompt_tokens": 217, "total_tokens": 334, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.

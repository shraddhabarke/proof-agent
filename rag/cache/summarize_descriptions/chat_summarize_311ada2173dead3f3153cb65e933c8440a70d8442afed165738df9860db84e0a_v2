This operation is symmetrical to another function named incr_left, indicating that both functions serve similar purposes but from different directional viewpoints. INCR_RIGHT is particularly used in scenarios where the value of a right ghost reference needs to be incremented, ensuring that the operation is protected by a lock to maintain data integrity and synchronization across threads.

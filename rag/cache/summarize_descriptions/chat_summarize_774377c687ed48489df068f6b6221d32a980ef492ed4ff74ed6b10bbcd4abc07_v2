It represents the arrow type, which is essentially the type of functions. TARR takes two types as input and produces a new function type, signifying the transformation from one type to another. This means that TARR is responsible for representing function types in STLC, specifically denoting the type of functions that take an argument of one type and return a value of another type. Through TARR, STLC is able to articulate the behavior and structure of functions within its type system, highlighting the transition from input types to output types within the calculus.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1742951680, "model": "gpt-4-0125-preview", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 141, "prompt_tokens": 218, "total_tokens": 359, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.

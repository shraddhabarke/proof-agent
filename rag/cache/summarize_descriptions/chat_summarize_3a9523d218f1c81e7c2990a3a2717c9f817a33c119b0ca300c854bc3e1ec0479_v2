This ghost appears to Scrooge to deliver a warning and is characterized by the chains he carries, made of cash-boxes, keys, padlocks, ledgers, deeds, and heavy purses wrought in steel, symbolizing the greed and selfishness that weighed him down in life. Marley's Ghost reflects on his own fate and warns Scrooge of an impending visit by three spirits, aiming to steer Scrooge away from the path that led Marley to his own dismal afterlife.

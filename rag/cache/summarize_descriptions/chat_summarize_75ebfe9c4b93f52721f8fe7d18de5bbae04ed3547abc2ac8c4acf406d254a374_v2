It ensures that when a function, denoted as e1, is applied to an argument, denoted as e2, the function e1 possesses an arrow type. Moreover, it verifies that e2 matches the type of e1's formal parameter. This process guarantees that the application of the function to the argument is type-safe, resulting in the return type of e1 being assigned as the type of the entire term. Essentially, TYAPP facilitates the correct application of functions to arguments, ensuring that the types are compatible and adhering to the strict type requirements of the STLC's type system.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1742951682, "model": "gpt-4-0125-preview", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 148, "prompt_tokens": 204, "total_tokens": 352, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.

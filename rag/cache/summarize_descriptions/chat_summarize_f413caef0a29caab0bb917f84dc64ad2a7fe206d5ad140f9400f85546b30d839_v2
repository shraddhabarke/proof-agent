It is designed for program verification, formal reasoning, and theorem proving. FSTAR serves as both a programming language and a proof assistant, enabling users to write mathematical proofs, software specifications, and verify properties of programs. The system is utilized for formalizing and verifying software properties, ensuring programs are correct through formal proofs. FSTAR employs tactics for proof development and is referenced in code through constructs such as FStar.Option.mapTot, highlighting its role in formal verification processes.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1748330899, "model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ee1d74bde0", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 121, "prompt_tokens": 725, "total_tokens": 846, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.

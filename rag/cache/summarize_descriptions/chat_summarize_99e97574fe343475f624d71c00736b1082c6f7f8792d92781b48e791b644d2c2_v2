It is specifically designed to define tuple types up to arity 14, offering both the structure for these tuples and syntactic sugar to facilitate operations on them. Beyond its focus on tuples, FSTAR.PERVASIVES.NATIVE serves a broader purpose by providing native pervasive definitions. This includes a range of fundamental definitions and functions essential for the language's operation, making it a core component of F*'s functionality. Through its comprehensive provision of tuple types and operations, alongside its delivery of fundamental language definitions, FSTAR.PERVASIVES.NATIVE is integral to the development and execution of programs in F*.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1742951724, "model": "gpt-4-0125-preview", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 147, "prompt_tokens": 204, "total_tokens": 351, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.

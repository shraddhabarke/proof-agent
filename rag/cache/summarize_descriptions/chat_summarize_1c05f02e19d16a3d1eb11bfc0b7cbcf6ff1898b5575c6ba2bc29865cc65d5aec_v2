This law asserts that the order in which bind operations are applied does not impact the outcome. ASSOC successfully demonstrates the associativity of the bind operation, ensuring that computations can be structured in a flexible manner without altering the result. This lemma is crucial for understanding and applying the principles of monads in programming and computational theory, providing a foundational proof that supports the reliability and predictability of monadic operations.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1742951727, "model": "gpt-4-0125-preview", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 103, "prompt_tokens": 169, "total_tokens": 272, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.

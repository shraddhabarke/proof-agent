Specifically, it is used to prove that pow2 12 equals 4096. This function not only illustrates the basic principles of computation within the F* programming language but also showcases how to prove assertions using tactics. Furthermore, POW2 is highlighted as an example in educational texts to demonstrate the capabilities of Meta-F*, a framework within F* that simplifies and proves assertions by employing tactics. Through POW2, learners and practitioners are introduced to the practical applications of proof by computation in programming, making it a fundamental example in the study of formal verification and programming language theory.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1742951687, "model": "gpt-4-0125-preview", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 137, "prompt_tokens": 216, "total_tokens": 353, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.

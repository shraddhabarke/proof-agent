It serves as a module or library in the F* codebase, providing a robust set of tools for tactic-based proof development and automated reasoning. TAC is instrumental in operations such as pattern matching, term normalization, and the manipulation of proof states and goals. It is designed to handle logical terms and bindings in a computational setting, offering a type or effect used in continuation functions. As a type representing a tactic computation, TAC facilitates tactical programming by providing functions for manipulating terms and binders, making it an essential component in the realm of proof development and automated reasoning within F*.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1748330965, "model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ee1d74bde0", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 144, "prompt_tokens": 322, "total_tokens": 466, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.

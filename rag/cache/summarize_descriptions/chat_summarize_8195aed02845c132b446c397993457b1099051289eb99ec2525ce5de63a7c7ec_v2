It serves as a crucial namespace or module in the code, specifically tailored for supporting formal verification processes. This module is instrumental in facilitating various computational and theoretical lemmas and proofs, particularly emphasizing the properties and applications of mathematical operations such as cancel_mul_mod, modular arithmetic, and more. Math is essentially a collection of functions and lemmas related to mathematical operations, implemented as a set of mathematical utilities or a library within the context of the document. Its primary function is to aid in the accurate and efficient execution of mathematical operations, thereby supporting the broader objectives of formal verification and computational proofs within FStar.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1747699544, "model": "gpt-4-0125-preview", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 161, "prompt_tokens": 262, "total_tokens": 423, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.

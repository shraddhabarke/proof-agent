It serves as a constructor in the program grammar of STLC, specifically denoting a lambda term that associates a variable with a type alongside a sub-program. This construct is instrumental in defining anonymous functions by specifying parameters and the body expression, thereby facilitating the creation of lambda expressions with type annotations. ELAM, therefore, encapsulates the essence of lambda expressions in STLC's type system, highlighting its role in indicating function definitions through the mechanism of lambda abstraction. This comprehensive understanding of ELAM underscores its significance in operational semantics and program grammar within STLC, showcasing its function in representing annotated lambda terms that are pivotal for the expression of lambda abstractions.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1742951681, "model": "gpt-4-0125-preview", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 159, "prompt_tokens": 241, "total_tokens": 400, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.

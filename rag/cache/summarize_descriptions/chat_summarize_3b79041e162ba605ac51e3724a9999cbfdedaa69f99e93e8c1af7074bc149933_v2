It contains two main components: a head, which is of type t and holds the data, and a tail, which is essentially a pointer to the next node in the list. This design allows for efficient data storage and retrieval by linking each NODE to its successor, thereby forming a coherent sequence of elements that can be navigated through the pointers.

Emacs, a versatile editor, offers a specific mode tailored for F* programming. This F* mode in Emacs is designed to facilitate both program development and interpretation, ensuring a seamless programming experience. Additionally, F* extends its support to Emacs users through a specific plugin, further solidifying the symbiotic relationship between the editor and the programming language. This integration allows programmers to efficiently write, interpret, and execute F* code directly within the Emacs environment, leveraging the strengths of both tools to optimize the programming workflow.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1742951755, "model": "gpt-4-0125-preview", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 124, "prompt_tokens": 180, "total_tokens": 304, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.

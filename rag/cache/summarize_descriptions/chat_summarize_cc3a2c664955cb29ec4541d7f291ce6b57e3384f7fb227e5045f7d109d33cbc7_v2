Initially, Fred is depicted engaging in a game where Scrooge is the answer, highlighting not only their familial connection but also Fred's participatory approach in trying to maintain a bond with his uncle. This relationship is further explored through the contrast between Scrooge's miserliness and Fred's generosity, underscoring the differences in their characters. Despite these differences, Fred persistently tries to involve Scrooge in Christmas celebrations, an effort that symbolizes his desire to mend the strained familial ties and bring warmth to Scrooge's life.

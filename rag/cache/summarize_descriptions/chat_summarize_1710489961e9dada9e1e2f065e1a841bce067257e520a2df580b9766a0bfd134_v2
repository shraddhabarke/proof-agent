This module is crucial for working with large numerical ranges, ensuring that operations are executed with careful consideration for bounded arithmetic to prevent overflow. As a bounded unsigned integer type, UINT64 is not only significant for its capacity to handle extensive numerical values but also serves as a key example in illustrating the application of typeclasses in programming. Its inclusion in the F* standard library underscores its importance in facilitating precise and safe arithmetic operations, making it an indispensable tool for developers requiring robust support for 64-bit unsigned integers.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1742951708, "model": "gpt-4-0125-preview", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 128, "prompt_tokens": 217, "total_tokens": 345, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.

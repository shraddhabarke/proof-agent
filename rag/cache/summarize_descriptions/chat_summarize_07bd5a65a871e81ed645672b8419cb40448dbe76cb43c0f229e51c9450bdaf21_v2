It is specifically focused on propositional extensionality, an axiom asserting the equality of equisatisfiable propositions. This module is not only a standalone component but is also referenced within FStar.TSet, indicating its integral role in handling propositional extensionality across the F* language. Its primary function is to facilitate the application and management of the propositional extensionality principle, ensuring that propositions which are equisatisfiable are treated as equal within the programming environment. This makes FSTAR.PROPOSITIONALEXTENSIONALITY a crucial element for developers working with the F* language, particularly in contexts where logical equivalence and proposition handling are of paramount importance.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1747699554, "model": "gpt-4-0125-preview", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 148, "prompt_tokens": 194, "total_tokens": 342, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.

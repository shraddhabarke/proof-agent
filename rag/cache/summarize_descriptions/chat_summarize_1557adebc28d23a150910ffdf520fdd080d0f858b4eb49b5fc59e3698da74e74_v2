It is designed to express non-terminating programs productively through corecursion and coinduction. AGDA includes advanced features such as universe polymorphism, which is detailed in its manual with a chapter on universes, drawing parallels to similar concepts in F*. This programming language is adept at demonstrating complex logical constructs, including the construction of Russell's Paradox through unsound impredicativity, showcasing its robust theoretical underpinnings.\n\nAs a proof assistant, AGDA is in the same league as Lean, Coq, and Meta-F*, offering capabilities for writing explicit proofs. It supports metaprogramming and tactics, which are essential for developing and verifying mathematical proofs, positioning it similarly to Meta-F* in terms of functionality. However, unlike F*, AGDA does not support cumulativity in its universe system, marking a distinct difference in its approach to type theory.\n\nAGDA's manual not only covers universe polymorphism but also delves into other sophisticated topics, affirming its role as a versatile tool for both programming and proof construction. Its ability to handle metaprogramming and tactics further enhances its utility in the verification of mathematical proofs, making it a valuable resource for researchers and developers alike who are engaged in the rigorous development of mathematical proofs and functional programming.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1742951693, "model": "gpt-4-0125-preview", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 286, "prompt_tokens": 338, "total_tokens": 624, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.

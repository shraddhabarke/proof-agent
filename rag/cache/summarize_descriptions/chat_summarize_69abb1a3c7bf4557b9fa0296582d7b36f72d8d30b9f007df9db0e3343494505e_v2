This class extends the capabilities of the bounded_unsigned_int class by incorporating a variety of operations such as addition, subtraction, strict comparison, and equality checks. It serves as a comprehensive tool for managing bounded unsigned integers within the F* programming environment, ensuring that users can perform necessary arithmetic and comparison operations within the constraints of unsigned integer bounds. Through BOUNDED_UNSIGNED_INT_OPS, F* provides a robust framework for dealing with bounded unsigned integers, making it an essential component for developers working within the language's type system.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1742951713, "model": "gpt-4-0125-preview", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 127, "prompt_tokens": 222, "total_tokens": 349, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.

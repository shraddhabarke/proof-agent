It is dedicated to providing a wide array of mathematical lemmas and proofs, specifically designed to support formal verification processes within the language. This module encompasses a broad spectrum of mathematical operations and properties, including but not limited to, modular arithmetic, properties of prime numbers, multiplication, division, and operations on integers and natural numbers. It also focuses on specific mathematical assertions such as add_div_mod_1 and lemma_mod_sub, which are essential for verifying mathematical properties in programs.\n\nThe module is known for its extensive collection of lemmas that are integral to proving properties about integers across various contexts, including FStar.Int32, FStar.Int8, and referenced within FStar.Int16 for mathematical lemma operations. It also includes lemmas for power and logarithmic operations, showcasing its versatility and comprehensive coverage of mathematical concepts required for formal verification and proofs within the programming environment.\n\nFSTAR.MATH.LEMMAS is not only a repository of mathematical lemmas but also provides tactics for proofs, making it a vital tool for developers working with the FStar programming language. It is accessible through the FStar.Math.Euclid module, indicating its interconnectedness within the FStar framework and its role in facilitating complex mathematical operations and verifications. This module stands as a testament to the robust mathematical foundation provided by the F* programming language, catering to the needs of developers seeking to ensure the correctness and reliability of their code through formal verification methods.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1747699544, "model": "gpt-4-0125-preview", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 306, "prompt_tokens": 558, "total_tokens": 864, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.

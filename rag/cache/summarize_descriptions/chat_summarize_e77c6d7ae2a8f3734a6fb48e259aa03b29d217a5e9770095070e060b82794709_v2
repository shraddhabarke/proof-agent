This concept is crucial in understanding the logical framework of F*, as it embodies a logical contradiction or an unsoundness within the proof system. Specifically, FALSE signifies a breakdown in the soundness of F*'s proof system, potentially allowing for the proof of false statements due to issues such as non-strictly positive types.

It encodes its functions, datatypes, and logical expressions directly into forms that are understandable by SMT (Satisfiability Modulo Theories) solvers. This encoding allows F* to leverage SMT solvers for the purpose of verifying the correctness of programs. Specifically, F* translates programs and their assertions into SMT to check the validity of these assertions, ensuring that the programs behave as intended. This process underscores F*'s commitment to creating secure and reliable software through formal verification techniques.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1742951773, "model": "gpt-4-0125-preview", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 115, "prompt_tokens": 180, "total_tokens": 295, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.

It serves as a unique identifier for resources, specifically facilitating the specification of resources within a Merkle tree structure for updates. RESOURCE_ID is represented through a path in the Merkle tree from the root to a leaf. This path is detailed as a list of booleans, indicating the direction to descend at each node, thereby providing a precise method to locate and identify resources in the tree. This mechanism allows for efficient updates and management of resources in systems utilizing Merkle trees by leveraging the RESOURCE_ID as a key identifier.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1742951675, "model": "gpt-4-0125-preview", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 121, "prompt_tokens": 192, "total_tokens": 313, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.

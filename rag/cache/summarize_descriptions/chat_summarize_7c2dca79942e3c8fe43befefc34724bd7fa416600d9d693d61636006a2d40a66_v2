It represents the most basic form of equality in this context, where terms that are related by reduction are deemed identical. This means that in F*, when two terms can be reduced to the same form through computation, they are considered to be definitionally equal. This approach to equality underscores the importance of computation in the framework of F* and highlights how definitional equality serves as a cornerstone for understanding and working with types in this setting.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1742951677, "model": "gpt-4-0125-preview", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 112, "prompt_tokens": 179, "total_tokens": 291, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.

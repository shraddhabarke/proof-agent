This foundational concept is crucial for reasoning about program correctness, providing a systematic method for proving the correctness of computer programs. Floyd's significant contribution to this area was highlighted in his paper titled \"Assigning Meaning to Programs,\" where he laid out the principles of Floyd-Hoare Logic.

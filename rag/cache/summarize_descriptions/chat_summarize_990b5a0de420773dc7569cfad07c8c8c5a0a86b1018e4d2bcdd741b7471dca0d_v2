It is classified as an action class specifically designed for the purpose of updating or modifying data in a given location. This action is integral to computation trees, where it plays a crucial role in writing data as part of the process flow. Furthermore, in the context of F*, WRITE is recognized as an essential action that updates the state in stateful computations.

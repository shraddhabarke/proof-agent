It is designed to ensure well-typed terms through its indexing structure, representing various data types and operations within its syntax. STLC is characterized by its abstract syntax and typing rules, which facilitate the description of computation through function abstraction and application. This system employs variable binding and substitution as its core mechanisms, allowing for the expression of computation in a structured and logical manner. By using typed variables, STLC provides a robust framework for defining and applying functions, making it an essential concept in the study of mathematical logic and computer science.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1742951698, "model": "gpt-4-0125-preview", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 143, "prompt_tokens": 301, "total_tokens": 444, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.

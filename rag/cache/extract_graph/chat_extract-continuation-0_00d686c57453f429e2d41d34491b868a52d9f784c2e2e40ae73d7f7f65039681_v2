The\n   ``#push-options`` pragma pushes additional options at the top of\n   the stack, while ``#pop-options`` pops the stack. The pattern used\n   here instructs F* to typecheck ``dyn`` only with the\n   ``__no_positivity`` option enabled. As we will see, the\n   ``__no_positivity`` option can be used to break soundness, so use\n   it only if you really know what you're doing.\n\nNow, having declared that ``dyn`` is a well-formed inductive type,\ndespite not being strictly positive, we can break the soundness of\nF*. In particular, we can write terms and claim they are total, when\nin fact their execution will loop forever.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Part2.Positivity.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: nopos_dyn_loop$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: nopos_dyn_loop$\n\nHere, the type of ``loop`` claims that it is a term that always\nevaluates in a finite number of steps to a value of type ``dyn``. Yet,\nreducing it produces an infinite chain of calls to ``loop'\n(Function loop')``. Admitting a non-positive definition like ``dyn``\nhas allowed us to build a non-terminating loop.\n\nSuch loops can also allow one to prove ``False`` (breaking soundness),\nas the next example shows.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Part2.Positivity.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: non_positive$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: non_positive$\n\nThis example is very similar to ``dyn``, except ``NP`` stores a\nnon-positive function that returns ``False``, which allows use to\nprove ``ff : False``, i.e., in this example, not only does the\nviolation of strict positivity lead to an infinite loop at runtime, it\nalso renders the entire proof system of F* useless, since one can\nprove ``False``.\n\nFinally, in the example below, although the type ``also_non_pos`` does\nnot syntactically appear to the left of an arrow in a field of the\n``ANP`` constructor, an instantiation of the type parameter ``f``\n(e.g., with the type ``f_false``) does make it appear to the left of\nan arrow---so this type too is deemed not strictly positive, and can be used\nto prove ``False``.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Part2.Positivity.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: also_non_positive$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: also_non_positive$\n\nWe hope you are convinced that non-strictly positive types should not\nbe admissible in inductive type definitions. In what follows, we will\nno longer use the ``__no_positivity`` option. In a later section, once\nwe've introduced the *effect of divergence*, we will see that\nnon-positive definitions can safely be used in a context where\nprograms are not expected to terminate, allowing one to safely model\nthings like the ``dyn`` type, without compromising the soundness of\nF*.\n\n.. _Part2_strictly_positive_annotations:\n\nStrictly Positive Annotations\n-----------------------------\n\nSometimes it is useful to parameterize an inductive definition with a\ntype function, without introducing a non-positive definition as we did\nin ``also_non_pos`` above.\n\nFor example, the definition below introduces a type ``free f a``, a \nform of a tree whose leaf nodes contain ``a`` values, and whose\ninternal nodes branch according the type function ``f``. \n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Part2.Positivity.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: free$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: free$\n\nWe can instantiate this generic ``free`` to produce various kinds of\ntrees. Note: when instantiating ``free list a`` in\n``variable_branching_list`` below, we need to explicitly re-define the\n``list`` type with a strict-positivity annotation: F* does not\ncorrectly support rechecking type constructors to prove that they are\nstrictly positive when they are used\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>F*<|>ORGANIZATION<|>F* is a programming language designed with an emphasis on formal verification, allowing for the specification and verification of properties of programs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DYN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>DYN is a type in F* that demonstrates a violation of strict positivity, leading to potential soundness issues in the language)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FUNCTION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>FUNCTION is a constructor in F* that can be used to define functions, including those that may lead to non-terminating loops if strict positivity is violated)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LOOP<|>EVENT<|>LOOP is an example of a non-terminating computation in F* that arises from a non-positive definition of the type DYN)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FALSE<|>EVENT<|>FALSE represents a breakdown in the soundness of F*'s proof system, allowing for the proof of false statements due to non-strictly positive types)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>NP is a type similar to DYN, storing a non-positive function that returns FALSE, further illustrating the dangers of non-strictly positive types in F*)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ANP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>ANP is another type that, through instantiation, demonstrates the issues with non-strictly positive types in F*, potentially leading to proofs of FALSE)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FREE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>FREE is a generic type in F* that allows for the creation of trees with variable branching, demonstrating a use of strictly positive annotations in type definitions)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DYN<|>F*<|>DYN is a type defined within F* that exemplifies the language's handling of strict positivity and its implications on soundness<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FUNCTION<|>LOOP<|>FUNCTION is related to LOOP as it is used to define the non-terminating computation example in F*<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LOOP<|>DYN<|>LOOP is a consequence of admitting DYN, a non-strictly positive type, into F*'s type system<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FALSE<|>NP<|>FALSE is a direct outcome of the non-strictly positive nature of NP, showcasing a critical soundness issue in F*<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ANP<|>FALSE<|>ANP, through instantiation, can be used to prove FALSE, highlighting the risks of non-strictly positive types<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FREE<|>F*<|>FREE is a type in F* that illustrates the language's capability to handle strictly positive annotations in type definitions<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

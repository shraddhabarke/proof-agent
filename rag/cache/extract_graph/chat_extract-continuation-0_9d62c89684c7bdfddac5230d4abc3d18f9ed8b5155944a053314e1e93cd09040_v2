We apply the induction hypothesis to ``n - 1`` and get ::\n\n        fibonacci (n - 1) >= n - 1\n\n    6. We have::\n\n        fibonacci n = //definition\n        fibonacci (n - 1) + fibonacci (n - 2) >= //from 5\n        (n - 1) + fibonacci (n - 2)\n\n    7. So, our goal is now::\n\n        (n - 1) + fibonacci (n - 2) >= n\n\n    8. It suffices if we can show ``fibonacci (n - 2) >= 1``\n\n    9. From (2) and the definition of ``fibonacci`` we have::\n\n         fibonacci (n - 1) = //definition\n         fibonacci (n - 2) + fibonacci (n - 3) >= //from 5\n         n - 1 >= // from 3\n         2\n\n\n    10. Now, suppose for contradiction, that ``fibonacci (n - 2) = 0``.\n\n        10.1. Then, from step 9, we have ``fibonacci (n-3) >= 2``\n\n        10.2  If ``n=3``, then ``fibonacci 0 = 1``, so we have a contradiction.\n\n        10.3  If ``n > 3``, then\n\n           10.3.1. ``fibonacci (n-2) = fibonacci (n-3) + fibonacci (n-4)``, by definition\n\n           10.3.2. ``fibonacci (n-3) + fibonacci (n-4) >= fibonacci (n-3)``, since ``fibonacci (n-4) : nat``.\n\n           10.3.3. ``fibonacci (n-2) >= fibonacci (n-3)``, using 10.3.1 and 10.3.2\n\n           10.3.4. ``fibonacci (n-2) >= 2``, using 10.1\n\n           10.3.5. But, 10.3.4 contradicts 10; so the proof is complete.\n\n    You probably wouldn't have come up with this proof yourself, and\n    indeed, it took us some puzzling to figure out how the SMT solver\n    was able to prove this lemma with just one use of the induction\n    hypothesis. But, there you have it. All of which is to say that\n    the SMT solver is quite powerful!\n\nExercise: A lemma about append\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\n:ref:`Earlier <Part1_inductives_append>`, we saw a definition of\n``append`` with the following type:\n\n.. code-block:: fstar\n\n  val append (#a:Type) (l1 l2:list a)\n    : l:list a{length l = length l1 + length l2}\n\nNow, suppose we were to define `app``, a version of ``append`` with a\nweaker type, as shown below.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Part1.Lemmas.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: def append alt\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: def append alt\n\nCan you prove the following lemma?\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Part1.Lemmas.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: sig app_length\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: sig app_length\n\n.. container:: toggle\n\n    .. container:: header\n\n       **Answer**\n\n    .. literalinclude:: ../code/Part1.Lemmas.fst\n       :language: fstar\n       :start-after: SNIPPET_START: def app_length\n       :end-before: SNIPPET_END: def app_length\n\n.. _Part1_intrinsic_extrinsic:\n\nIntrinsic vs extrinsic proofs\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nAs the previous exercise illustrates, you can prove properties either\nby enriching the type of a function or by writing a separate lemma\nabout it---we call these the 'intrinsic' and 'extrinsic' styles,\nrespectively. Which style to prefer is a matter of taste and\nconvenience: generally useful properties are often good candidates for\nintrinsic specification (e.g, that ``length`` returns a ``nat``); more\nspecific properties are better stated and proven as lemmas. However,\nin some cases, as in the following example, it may be impossible to\nprove a property of a function directly in its type---you must resort\nto a lemma.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Part1.Lemmas.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: SNIPPET_START: reverse\n   :end-before: SNIPPET_END: reverse\n\nLet's try proving that reversing a list twice is the identity\nfunction.  It's possible to *specify* this property in the type of\n``reverse`` using a refinement type.\n\n.. code-block:: fstar\n\n   val reverse (#a:Type) : f:(list a -> list a){forall l. l == f (f l)}\n\n.. note::\n\n   A subtle point: the refinement on ``reverse`` above uses a\n   :ref:`propositional equality\n   <Part1_ch2_propositional_equality>`.

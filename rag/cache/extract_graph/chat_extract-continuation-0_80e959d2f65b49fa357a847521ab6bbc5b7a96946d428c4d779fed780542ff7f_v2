A good rule of thumb is the following: Do not write a val declaration for a term, unless you are\nwriting an interface . Instead, directly\nwrite a let or type definition and annotate it with the\ntype you expect it to have—this will lead to fewer\nsurprises. For example, instead of separating the val tup2 from let tup2 just write them together, as shown below, and F*\ninfers the correct universes. let tuple2 (a:Type) (b:Type) : Type = a & b If you must write a val f : t , because, say, the type t is\nhuge, or because you are writing an interface, it’s a good idea to\nbe explicit about universes, so that when defining f , you know\nexactly how general you have to be in terms of universes; and,\nconversely, users of f know exactly how much universe\npolymorphism they are getting. For example: val tup2_again (a:Type u#a) (b:Type u#b) : Type u#(max a b) let tup2_again a b = a & b\n\nval tup2 (a:Type) (b:Type) : Type\n\n\nlet tup2 a b = a & b\n\n\nType u#(max uu___43588 uu___43589) is not a subtype of the expected type Type u#uu___43590\n\n\n- Do not write a val declaration for a term, unless you are\nwriting an interface .

For example, instead of separating the val tup2 from let tup2 just write them together, as shown below, and F*\ninfers the correct universes. let tuple2 (a:Type) (b:Type) : Type = a & b\n\nlet tuple2 (a:Type) (b:Type) : Type = a & b\n\n\n- If you must write a val f : t , because, say, the type t is\nhuge, or because you are writing an interface, it’s a good idea to\nbe explicit about universes, so that when defining f , you know\nexactly how general you have to be in terms of universes; and,\nconversely, users of f know exactly how much universe\npolymorphism they are getting.

For example, one might think to define lists this way: noeq type list_alt : Type u#a -> Type u#(a + 1) = \n  | NilAlt: a:Type -> list_alt a\n  | ConsAlt: a:Type -> hd:a -> tl:list_alt a -> list_alt a Although semantically equivalent to the standard list type list (a:Type u#a) : Type u#a  =\n | Nil : list a\n | Cons : hd:a -> tl:list a -> list a list_alt produces a type in u#(a + 1) , since both NilAlt and ConsAlt have fields of type a:Type u#a . So, unless the\nindex of your type varies among the constructors, use a parameter\ninstead of an index. That said, recall that it’s the fields of the constructors of the\ninductive type that count. You can index your type by a type in any\nuniverse and it doesn’t influence the result type. Here’s an\nartificial example. type t : Type u#100 -> Type u#0 = \n  | T : unit -> t (FStar.Universe.raise_t unit)\n\nnoeq\ntype list_alt : Type u#a -> Type u#(a + 1) = \n  | NilAlt: a:Type -> list_alt a\n  | ConsAlt: a:Type -> hd:a -> tl:list_alt a -> list_alt a\n\n\ntype list (a:Type u#a) : Type u#a  =\n | Nil : list a\n | Cons : hd:a -> tl:list a -> list a\n\n\ntype t : Type u#100 -> Type u#0 = \n  | T : unit -> t (FStar.Universe.raise_t unit)\n\n\n© Copyright 2020, Microsoft Research.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>F*<|>ORGANIZATION<|>F* is a programming language designed to be a tool for software verification, allowing for the specification and verification of properties of software programs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INTERFACE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>In the context of F*, an interface refers to a specification that defines a set of functionalities that a component or a type must implement)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TUPLE2<|>EVENT<|>Tuple2 represents a type definition or a value declaration in F* that combines two types into a single type)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TUP2_AGAIN<|>EVENT<|>Tup2_again is a specific implementation or declaration in F* that demonstrates the use of universe polymorphism by specifying universes explicitly for a tuple type)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LIST_ALT<|>EVENT<|>List_alt is an alternative implementation of a list type in F*, showcasing the use of indexes over parameters to achieve types in different universes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LIST<|>EVENT<|>List represents the standard list type in F*, which is defined using type parameters to keep types in the same universe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>T<|>EVENT<|>T is an artificial example in F* that demonstrates how indexing a type by a type in any universe does not influence the result type)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TUPLE2<|>INTERFACE<|>Tuple2 is an example where separating val declaration from let is discouraged unless writing an interface<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TUP2_AGAIN<|>INTERFACE<|>Tup2_again is an example where being explicit about universes is recommended, especially when writing an interface<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LIST_ALT<|>LIST<|>List_alt and List demonstrate different approaches to defining list types in F*, with List_alt using indexes and List using parameters<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>T<|>LIST_ALT<|>T and List_alt both involve discussions on how to define types in F* to achieve desired universe levels<|>4)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

In this chapter, we’ll write some programs with branches\nof two kinds: if/else and match .\n\nHere’s a simple program that returns the maximum value stored in two\nreferences.\n\nlet max_spec x y = if x < y then y else x\n\n```pulse\nfn max #p #q (x y:ref int)\nrequires pts_to x #p 'vx ** pts_to y #q 'vy\nreturns n:int\nensures pts_to x #p 'vx ** pts_to y #q 'vy\n        ** pure (n == max_spec 'vx 'vy)\n{\n    let vx = !x;\n    let vy = !y;\n    if (vx > vy)\n    {\n        vx\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        vy\n    }\n}\n```\n\n\nThis program illustrates a very common specification style.\n\n- We have a pure, F* function max_spec\n\n- And a Pulse function working on mutable references, with a\nspecification that relates it to the pure F* spec. In this case,\nwe prove that max behaves like max_spec on the logical\nvalues that witness the contents of the two references.\n\nThe implementation of max uses a Pulse conditional statement. Its\nsyntax is different from the F* if-then-else expression: Pulse\nuses a more imperative syntax with curly braces, which should be\nfamiliar from languages like C.\n\nPulse’s inference machinery does not yet support conditionals that\nappear in non-tail position. For example, this variant of max fails, with the error message shown below.\n\nfn max_alt #p #q (x y:ref int)\nrequires pts_to x #p 'vx ** pts_to y #q 'vy\nreturns n:int\nensures pts_to x #p 'vx ** pts_to y #q 'vy\n        ** pure (n == max_spec 'vx 'vy)\n{\n    let mut result = 0;\n    let vx = !x;\n    let vy = !y;\n    if (vx > vy)\n    {\n        result := vx;\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        result := vy;\n    };\n    !result;\n}\n\n\nPulse cannot yet infer a postcondition for a non-tail conditional statement;\nEither annotate this `if` with `returns` clause; or rewrite your code to use a tail conditional\n\n\nHere’s an annotated version of max_alt that succeeds.\n\nfn max_alt #p #q (x y:ref int)\nrequires pts_to x #p 'vx ** pts_to y #q 'vy\nreturns n:int\nensures pts_to x #p 'vx ** pts_to y #q 'vy\n        ** pure (n == max_spec 'vx 'vy)\n{\n    let mut result = 0;\n    let vx = !x;\n    let vy = !y;\n    if (vx > vy)\n    ensures\n     exists* r.\n       pts_to x #p 'vx **\n       pts_to y #q 'vy **\n       pts_to result r **\n       pure (r == max_spec 'vx 'vy)\n    {\n        result := vx;\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        result := vy;\n    };\n    !result;\n}\n\n\nWe are working on adding inference for non-tail conditionals.\n\nTo illustrate the use of pattern matching, consider the following\nrepresentation of a possibly null reference.\n\nlet nullable_ref a = option (ref a)\n\nlet pts_to_or_null #a\n        (x:nullable_ref a) \n        (#[default_arg (`1.0R)] p:perm) //implicit argument with a default\n        (v:option a)\n: vprop\n= match x with\n  | None -> pure (v == None)\n  | Some x -> exists* w. pts_to x #p w ** pure (v == Some w)\n\n\nWe can represent a nullable ref as just an option (ref a) coupled\nwith a representation predicate, pts_to_or_null . A few points to\nnote:\n\n- The notation (#[default_arg (\\`1.0R)] p:perm) is F*\nsyntax for an implicit argument which when omitted defaults to 1.0R —this is exactly how predicates like Pulse.Lib.Reference.pts_to are defined.\n\n- The definition is by cases: if the reference x is None ,\nthen the logical witness is None too.\n\n- Otherwise, the underlying reference points to some value w and\nthe logical witness v == Some w agrees with that value.\n\nNote, one might consider defining it this way:\n\nlet pts_to_or_null #a\n     (x:nullable_ref a)\n     (#[default_arg (`1.0R)] p:perm)\n     (v:option a)\n: vprop\n= match x with\n  | None -> pure (v == None)\n  | Some x -> pure (Some? v) ** pts_to x #p (Some?.v v)\n\n\nHowever, unlike F*’s conjunction p /\\ q where the well-typedness\nof q can rely on p , the ** operator is not left-biased; so (Some?.v v) cannot be proven in this context and the definition is\nrejected.\n\nAnother style might be as follows:\n\nlet pts_to_or_null #a\n     (x:nullable_ref a)\n     (#[default_arg (`1.0R)] p:perm)\n     (v:option a)\n: vprop\n= match x, v with\n  | None, None -> emp\n  | Some x, Some w -> pts_to x #p w\n  | _ -> pure False\n\n\nThis could also work, though it would require handling an additional\n(impossible) case.\n\nLet’s try our first pattern match in Pulse:\n\nfn read_nullable #\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_9c2d9a2e082e598e88c6254ad3b37b56ff9ad8b3c163fc32419173bd76e1adc3_v2"}

p main q``, a statement of\ncorrectess of the ``main`` program.\n\nAssignment\n++++++++++\n\nOur first rule is for reasoning about variable assignment:\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Imp.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: assignment$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: assignment$\n\nThis lemma says that ``post`` holds after executing ``x := e`` in the\ninitial state ``s0``, if ``post`` holds on the initial state updated\nat ``x`` with the value of ``e``.\n\nFor example, to prove that after executing ``z := y + 1`` in ``s0``,\nif we expect the value of ``z`` to be greater than zero`, then the\nassignment rule says that ``read s0 y + 1 > 0`` should hold before the\nassignment, which is what we would expect.\n\nSequence\n++++++++\n\nOur next lemma about triples stitches together triples for two\nprograms that are sequentially composed:\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Imp.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: sequence$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: sequence$\n\nThe lemma says that if we can derive the Hoare triples of the two\nstatements such that postcondition of ``p1`` matches the precondition\nof ``p2``, then we can compose them.\n\n\nConditional\n+++++++++++\n\nThe lemma for conditionals is next:\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Imp.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: conditional$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: conditional$\n\nIt says that to derive the postcondition ``post`` from the ``If e p1\np2``, we should be able to derive it from each of the branches with the\nsame precondition ``pre``. In addition, since we know that ``p1``\nexecutes only when ``e`` is non-zero, we can add these facts to the\npreconditions of each branch.\n\nRepeat\n++++++\n\nIn all the cases so far, these lemmas are proved automated by F* and\nZ3. In the case of repeats, however, we need to do a little more work,\nsince an inductive argument is involved.\n\nThe rule for ``repeat`` requires a *loop invariant* ``inv``.  The loop\ninvariant is an assertion that holds before the loop starts, is\nmaintained by each iteration of the loop, and is provided as the\npostcondition of the loop.\n\nThe lemma below states that if we can prove that ``triple inv p inv``,\nthen we can also prove ``triple inv (Repeat e p) inv``.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Imp.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: repeat$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: repeat$\n\nThe auxiliary lemma ``repeat_n`` proves that ``run_repeat p n``\npreserves ``inv``, if ``p`` preserves ``inv``.\n\nTo call this lemma from the main ``repeat`` lemma, we need to \"get\nour hands on\" the initial state ``s0``, and the :ref:`syntactic sugar\nto manipulate logical connectives <Part2_connectives>` makes this\npossible.\n\n\nConsequence\n+++++++++++\n\nThe final lemma about our Hoare triples is called the rule of\nconsequence. It allows strengthening the precondition and weakening\nthe postcondition of a triple.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Imp.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: consequence$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: consequence$\n\nA precondition of a program is an obligation before the statement\nis executed. So if ``p`` requires ``pre``, we can always strengthen\nthe precondition to ``pre'``, provided ``pre' ==> pre``, i.e. it is\nlogically valid to require more than necessary in the\nprecondition. Similarly, postcondition is what a statement\nguarantees. So if ``p`` guarantees ``post``, we can always weaken it\nto guarantee less, i.e. some ``post'`` where ``post ==> post'``.\n\nWeakest Preconditions\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nThe rules of Floyd-Hoare logic provide an abstract way to reason about\nprograms. However, the rules of the logic are presented\ndeclaratively. For example, to apply the ``sequence`` rule, one has\nderive triples for each component in a way that they prove exactly the\nsame assertion (``pre_mid``) about the intermediate state. There may\nbe many ways to do this, e.g., one could apply the rule of\nconsequence to weaken the postcondition of the first component, or to\nstrengthen the precondition of the second component.\n\nDijkstra's system of weakest preconditions eliminates such ambiguity\nand provides an *algorithm* for computing valid Hoare triples,\nprovided the invariants of all loops are given. This makes weakest\npreconditions the basis of many program proof tools, since given a\nprogram annotated with loop invariants, one can simply compute a\nlogical formula (called a verification condition) whose validity\nimplies the correctness of the program.\n\nAt the core of the approach is a function ``WP (c, Q)``, which\ncomputes a unique, weakest precondition ``P`` for the program ``c``\nand postcondition ``Q``. The semantics of ``WP`` is that ``WP (c, Q)``\nis the weakest precondition that should hold before executing ``c``\nfor the postcondition ``Q`` to\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>F*<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A programming language and environment for formal verification)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Z3<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A theorem prover from Microsoft Research)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HOARE TRIPLE<|>EVENT<|>A statement in computer science used to reason about the correctness of computer programs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WEAKEST PRECONDITIONS<|>EVENT<|>A concept in computer science for determining the most general assertion that guarantees the postcondition of a program segment)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>F*<|>Z3<|>F* uses Z3 for automated proof verification<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HOARE TRIPLE<|>WEAKEST PRECONDITIONS<|>Weakest Preconditions provide a systematic way to compute Hoare Triples<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

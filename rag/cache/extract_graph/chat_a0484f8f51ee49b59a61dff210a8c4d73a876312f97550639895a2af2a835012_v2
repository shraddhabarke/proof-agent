For example, proving that ``add_mod (u 2)\n(u 3) == u 5`` requires reasoning about modular arithmetic---for\nconstants like ``2``, ``3``, and ``5`` this is easy enough, but proofs\nabout modular arithmetic over symbolic values will, in general, involve\nreasoning about non-linear arithmetic, which is difficult to automate\neven with an SMT solver. Besides, in many safety critical software\nsystems, one often prefers to avoid integer overflow altogether.\n\nSo, the ``UInt32`` interface also provides two additional operations,\n``add`` and ``sub``, whose specification enables two ``t`` values to be added\n(resp. subtracted) only if there is no overflow (or underflow).\n\nFirst, we define an auxiliary predicate ``fits`` to state when an\noperation does not overflow or underflow.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/UInt32.fsti\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: fits$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: fits$\n\nThen, we use ``fits`` to restrict the domain of ``add`` and ``sub``\nand the type ensures that the result is the sum (resp. difference) of\nthe arguments, without need for any modular arithmetic.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/UInt32.fsti\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: add$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: add$\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/UInt32.fsti\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: sub$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: sub$\n\n.. note ::\n\n   Although the addition operator can be used as a first-class\n   function with the notation ``(+)``, the same does not work for\n   subtraction, since ``(-)`` resolves to unary integer negation,\n   rather than subtraction---so, we write ``fun x y -> x - y``.\n\nComparison\n..........\n\nFinally, the interface also provides a comparison operator ``lt``, as\nspecified below:\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/UInt32.fsti\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: lt$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: lt$\n\nImplementation: UInt32.fst\n--------------------------\n\nAn implementation of ``UInt32`` must provide definitions for\nall the ``val`` declarations in the ``UInt32`` interface, starting\nwith a representation for the abstract type ``t``.\n\nThere are multiple possible representations for ``t``, however the\npoint of the interface is to isolate client modules from these\nimplementation choices.\n\nPerhaps the easiest implementation is to represent ``t`` as a\n``u32_nat`` itself. This makes proving the correspondence between\n``t`` and its logical model almost trivial.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/UInt32.fst\n   :language: fstar\n\nAnother choice may be to represent ``t`` as a 32-bit vector. This is a\nbit harder and proving that it is correct with respect to the\ninterface requires handling some interactions between Z3's theory of\nbit vectors and uninterpreted functions, which we handle with a\ntactic. This is quite advanced, and we have yet to cover F*'s support\nfor tactics, but we show the code below for reference.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/UInt32BV.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: UInt32BV$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: UInt32BV$\n\nAlthough both implementations correctly satisfy the ``UInt32``\ninterface, F* requires the user to pick one. Unlike module systems in some\nother ML-like languages, where interfaces are first-class entities\nwhich many modules can implement, in F* an interface can have at most\none implementation. For interfaces with multiple implementations, one\nmust use typeclasses.\n\n\nInterleaving: A Quirk\n---------------------\n\nThe current F* implementation views an interface and its\nimplementation as two partially implemented halves of a module. When\nchecking that an implementation is a correct implementation of an\ninterface, F* attempts to combine the two halves into a complete\nmodule before typechecking it. It does this by trying to *interleave*\nthe top-level elements of the interface and implementation, preserving\ntheir relative order.\n\nThis implementation strategy is far from optimal in various ways and a\nrelic from a time when F*'s implementation did not support separate\ncompilation. This implementation strategy is likely to change in the\nfuture (see `this issue\n<https://github.com/FStarLang/FStar/issues/1770>`_ for\ndetails).\n\nMeanwhile, the main thing to keep in mind when implementing interfaces\nis the following:\n\n  * The order of definitions in an implementation much match the order\n    of ``val`` declarations in the interface. E.g., if the interface\n    contains ``val f : tf`` followed by ``val g : tg``, then the\n    implementation of ``f`` must precede the implementation of ``g``.\n\nAlso, remember that if you are writing\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_a0484f8f51ee49b59a61dff210a8c4d73a876312f97550639895a2af2a835012_v2"}

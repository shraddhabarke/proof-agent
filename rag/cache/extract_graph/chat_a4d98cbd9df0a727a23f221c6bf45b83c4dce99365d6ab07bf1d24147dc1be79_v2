But, the program looks obscure \"just\"\nbecause it's using a convoluted syntax to call ``bind``. Many\nlanguages, most famously Haskell, provide specialized syntax to\nsimplify writing computations that work with APIs like ``bind`` and\n``return``. F* provides some syntactic sugar to handle this too.\n\nMonadic let bindings\n++++++++++++++++++++\n\nThe definition below defines a function with a special name\n``let!``. Names of this form, the token ``let`` followed by a sequence\nof one or more operator characters such as ``!``, ``?``, ``@``, ``$``,\n``<``, and ``>`` are monadic let-binding operators. \n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Part2.STInt.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: let!$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: let!$\n\nWith ``let!`` in scope, the following syntactic sugar becomes available:\n\n* Instead of writing ``bind f (fun x -> e)`` you can write ``let! x = f in e``.\n\n* Instead of writing ``bind f (fun _ -> e)`` you can write ``f ;!\n  e``, i.e., a semicolon followed the sequence of operator characters\n  uses in the monadic let-binding operator.\n\n* Instead of writing ``bind f (fun x -> match x with ...)``, you can\n  write ``match! f with ...``\n\n* Instead of writing ``bind f (fun x -> if x then ...)``, you can\n  write ``if! f then ...``\n\nSee this file `MonadicLetBindings.fst\n<https://github.com/FStarLang/FStar/blob/master/examples/misc/MonadicLetBindings.fst>`_\nfor more details an examples of the syntactic sugar.\n\nUsing this syntactic sugar, we come to our final version of\n``read_and_increment``, where now, hopefully, the imperative-looking\nstate updates make the intent of our program clear.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Part2.STInt.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: read_and_increment$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: read_and_increment$\n\nHaving structured our programs with ``return`` and ``bind``, larger\n``st`` computations can be built from smaller ones, without having to\nworry about how to plumb the state through---that's handled once and\nfor all by our combinators.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Part2.STInt.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: inc_twice$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: inc_twice$\n\n.. _Part2_monad_intro:\n\n``st`` is a monad\n-----------------\n\nIt turns out that every API that is structured like our ``st`` is an\ninstance of a general pattern called a *monad*, an algebraic\nstructure. Specifically, a monad consists of:\n\n  * A type operator ``m : Type -> Type``\n  * A function ``return (#a:Type) (x:a) : m a``\n  * A function ``bind (#a #b:Type) (f:m a) (g: a -> m b) : m b``\n\nwhich satisfy the following laws, where `~` is some suitable\nequivalence relation on ``m a``\n\n  * Left identity: ``bind (return x) f ~ f``\n  * Right identity: ``bind f return ~ f``\n  * Associativity: ``bind f1 (fun x -> bind (f2 x) f3) ~ bind (bind f1 f2) f3``\n\nIts easy to prove that ``st``, ``return``, and ``bind`` satisfy these\nlaws in F*, where we pick the equivalence relation to equate functions\nthat take equal arguments to equal results.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Part2.STInt.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: monad_laws$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: monad_laws$\n\nThese laws are practically useful in that they can catch bugs\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_a4d98cbd9df0a727a23f221c6bf45b83c4dce99365d6ab07bf1d24147dc1be79_v2"}

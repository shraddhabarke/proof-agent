Raw vectors receive special treatment during extraction,\n        especially by KaRaMeL, which extracts a vector to a raw C\n        pointer. When extracting to OCaml, a `raw a l` is a\n        `Batteries.Vect t a`\n\n     2. The length of a vector is representable in a U32.t\n\n     3. The interface is designed around a length-indexed type: this\n        enables the compilation to raw pointers, since this ensures\n        that all functions that manipulate vectors always have a U32\n        variable describing that vector's length in scope.\n\n        A length-indexed interface is also suitable for clients for whom\n        proving properties about the length is a primary concern: the\n        signatures in this interface carry intrinsic proofs about length\n        properties, simplifying proof obligations in client code.\n\n     4. Raw vectors lack decidable equality (since that cannot be\n        implemented given the representation choice in KaRaMeL)\n\n   The type `t a`: A dynamically sized vector\n\n     1. Conceptually, a `t a` is a pair of a `len:U32.t` and a `raw a\n        len`. They are implemented as such by KaRaMeL. When extracting\n        to OCaml, `t a` is identical to `raw a _`, i.e., it is still\n        extracted to a `Batteries.Vect.t a`\n\n     2. Unlike raw vectors, `t a` supports decidable equality when it\n        is supported by `a`. This is the main reason `t a` is provided\n        at an abstract type, rather than being exposed as a pair of a\n        U32 and a raw vector, since the latter does not support\n        decidable equality.\n\n   @summary Immutable vectors whose length is less than  `pow2 32`\n*)\n\nmodule FStar.Vector.Base\nmodule U32 = FStar.UInt32\nmodule S = FStar.Seq\n\n////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n/// The basic model of raw vectors as u32-length sequences\n////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n\n/// The length of a vector fits in 32 bits\nlet len_t = U32.t\n\n/// A raw vector.\n///   - `vector a n` is extracted to an `a*` in C by KaRaMeL\n///   - Does not support decidable equality\nval raw ([@@@strictly_positive] a:Type u#a)\n        (l:len_t)\n  : Type u#a\n\n/// A convenience to use `nat` for the length of vector in specs and proofs\nlet raw_length (#a:Type) (#l:len_t) (v:raw a l) : GTot nat = U32.v l\n\n(**\n    Abstractly, a `vec a l` is just a sequence whose length is `U32.v l`.\n    `reveal` and `hide` build an isomorphism establishing this\n**)\n\nval reveal:\n    #a:Type\n  -> #l:len_t\n  -> v:raw a l\n  -> GTot (s:S.seq a{S.length s = raw_length v})\n\nval hide:\n    #a:Type\n  -> s:S.seq a{S.length s < pow2 32}\n  -> GTot (raw a (U32.uint_to_t (S.length s)))\n\nval hide_reveal:\n    #a:Type\n  -> #l:len_t\n  -> v:raw a l\n  -> Lemma (ensures (hide (reveal v) == v))\n          [SMTPat (reveal v)]\n\nval reveal_hide:\n    #a:Type\n  -> s:S.seq a{S.length s < pow2 32}\n  -> Lemma (ensures (reveal (hide s) == s))\n          [SMTPat (hide s)]\n\n/// Extensional equality for vectors\nlet equal (#a:Type) (#l:len_t) (v1:raw a l) (v2:raw a l) =\n    Seq.equal (reveal v1) (reveal v2)\n\n/// Extensional equality can be used to prove syntactic equality\nval extensionality:\n    #a:Type\n  -> #l:len_t\n  -> v1:raw a l\n  -> v2:raw a l\n  -> Lemma (requires (equal v1 v2))\n          (ensures (v1 == v2))\n\n////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n/// end of the basic model\n////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n\n\n////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n/// A small set of basic operations on raw vectors, corresponding to the operations\n/// on sequences.

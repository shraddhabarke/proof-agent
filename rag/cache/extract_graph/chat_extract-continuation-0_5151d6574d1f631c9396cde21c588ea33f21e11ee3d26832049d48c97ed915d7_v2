The type\nhas two indices, such that mtree n h is the type of a Merkle\ntree of height n whose root node is associated with the hash h .\n\nLeaves are trees of height 0 and are constructed using L res ,\nwhere the hash associated with this node is just hash res , the\nhash of the resource stored at the leaf.\n\nInternal nodes of the tree are constructed using N left right ,\nwhere both the left and right trees have the same height n , producing a tree of height n + 1 . More interestingly, the\nhash associated with N left right is hash (concat hl hr) , the\nhash of the concatenation of hashes of the left and right subtrees.\n\ntype mtree: nat -> hash_t -> Type =\n  | L:\n     res:resource ->\n     mtree 0 (hash res)\n       \n  | N:\n     #n:nat ->\n     #hl:hash_t ->\n     #hr:hash_t ->\n     left:mtree n hl ->\n     right:mtree n hr ->\n     mtree (n + 1) (hash (concat hl hr))\n\n\nIn our previous examples like vectors, the index of the type\nabstracts, or summarizes, some property of the type, e.g., the\nlength. This is also the case with mtree , where the first index is\nan abstraction summarizing only the height of the tree; the second\nindex, being a cryptographic hash, summarizes the entire contents of\nthe tree.\n\nA resource identifier resource_id is a path in the tree from the\nroot to the leaf storing that resource. A path is just a list of\nbooleans describing whether to descend left or right from a node.\n\nJust like a regular binary tree, it’s easy to access an element in the\ntree by specifying its resource_id .\n\nImplement a function to access an element in a mtree in given a rid : list bool . Figuring out its type, including its decreases\nclause, is the most interesting part. The function itself is\nstraightforward.\n\nExercise file\n\nAnswer\n\nlet resource_id = list bool\n\nlet rec get #h \n            (ri:resource_id)\n            (tree:mtree (L.length ri) h)\n  : Tot resource (decreases ri)\n  = match ri with\n    | [] -> L?.res tree\n    | b::ri' ->\n      if b then\n\tget ri' (N?.left tree)\n      else\n\tget ri' (N?.right tree)\n\n\nUnlike the ordinary get function, we can define a function get_with_evidence that retrieves a resource from the tree together\nwith some evidence that that resource really is present in the tree.\nThe evidence contains the resource identifier and the hashes of\nsibling nodes along the path from root to that item.\n\nFirst, we define resource_with_evidence n , an indexed type that\npackages a res:resource with its rid:resource_id and hashes:list hash_t —both rid and hashes have the same\nlength, which is the index of the constructed type.\n\nThe function get_with_evidence is similar to get , except as it\nreturns from descending into a child node, it adds the hash of the\nother child node to the list of hashes.\n\ntype resource_with_evidence : nat -> Type =\n  | RES:\n      res:resource ->\n      ri:resource_id ->\n      hashes:list hash_t { L.length ri == L.length hashes } ->\n      resource_with_evidence (L.length ri)\n\n/// Retrieves data references by the path, together with the hashes\n/// of the sibling nodes along that path\nlet rec get_with_evidence (#h:_)\n                          (rid:resource_id)\n                          (tree:mtree (L.length rid) h)\n  : Tot (resource_with_evidence (L.length rid))\n\t(decreases rid)\n  = match rid with\n    | [] ->\n      RES (L?.res tree) [] []\n\n    | bit::rid' ->\n      let N #_ #hl #hr left right = tree in\n      let p = get_with_evidence rid' left in\n      if bit then\n\tlet p = get_with_evidence rid' left in\n\tRES p.res rid (hr :: p.hashes)\n      else\n\tlet p = get_with_evidence rid' right in\n\tRES p.res rid (hl :: p.hashes)\n\n\nIn the cryptographic literature, this function is sometimes called the prover . A RES r ri hs is a claimed proof of the membership\nof r in the tree at the location specified by ri .\n\nGoing back to our motivating scenario, artifacts distributed by our\ncontent provider would be elements of the type resource_with_evidence n , enabling clients to verify that a given\nartifact is authentic, as shown next.\n\nOur next step is to build a checker of claimed proofs, sometimes\ncalled a verifier . The function verify below takes a p:resource_with_evidence n , re-computes the root hash from the\nevidence presented, and checks that that hash matches the root hash of\na given Merkle tree. Note, the tree itself is irrelevant: all\nthat’s needed to verify the evidence is the root hash of the Merkle\ntree.\n\nlet verify #h #n (p:resource_with_evidence n) \n                 (tree:mtree n h)\n  : bool\n  = compute_root_hash p = h\n\n\nThe main work is done by compute_root_hash , shown below.\n\n- In the first branch, we simply hash the resource itself.\n\n- In the second branch, we recompute the hash from the tail of the\npath, and then based on which direction was taken, we either\nconcatenate sibling hash on the left or the right, and hash the\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MTREE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A Merkle tree structure that organizes data with cryptographic hashes for security and verification purposes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RESOURCE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Data or information stored within the leaves of a Merkle tree)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RESOURCE_ID<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A path in the Merkle tree from the root to a leaf, represented as a list of booleans, indicating the direction to descend at each node)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RESOURCE_WITH_EVIDENCE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An indexed type packaging a resource with its resource identifier and a list of hashes, providing evidence of the resource's presence in the tree)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RESOURCE<|>MTREE<|>Resources are stored within the leaves of an mtree, with their presence verified through cryptographic hashes<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RESOURCE_ID<|>MTREE<|>A resource_id is used to navigate through an mtree to access a specific resource<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RESOURCE_WITH_EVIDENCE<|>RESOURCE<|>Resource_with_evidence packages a resource along with its identifier and hashes for verification purposes<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RESOURCE_WITH_EVIDENCE<|>RESOURCE_ID<|>Resource_with_evidence includes a resource_id as part of its structure for locating the resource in the tree<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

Below, we define\n``ty_poly`` as ``Type u#a``, for any universe variable ``a``, and so\n``ty`` has type ``Type u#(a + 1)``.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Universes.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: ty_poly$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: ty_poly$\n\nOne way to think of ``ty_poly`` is as a \"definition template\"\nparameterized by the by the universe-variable ``a``. One can\ninstantiate ``ty_poly`` with a specific universe level ``l`` (by\nwriting ``ty_poly u#l``) and obtain a copy of its definition\nspecialized to level ``l``. F* can prove that instantiation of\n``ty_poly`` are equal to the non-polymorphic definitions we had\nearlier. As the last example shows, F* can usually infer the universe\ninstantiation, so you often don't need to write it.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Universes.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: ty_poly_assert$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: ty_poly_assert$\n\nUniverse computations for other types\n-------------------------------------\n\nEvery type in F* lives in a particular universe. For example, here are\nsome common types in ``Type u#0``.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Universes.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: some common types$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: some common types$\n\n\n**Universe of an arrow type**: In general, the universe of an arrow\ntype ``x:t -> t'`` is the the maximum of the universe of ``t`` and\n``t'``.\n      \nThis means that functions that are type-polymorphic live in higher\nuniverses. For example, the polymorphic identity function that we saw\nin an :ref:`earlier section <Part1_polymorphism_and_inference>`, is\nactually also polymorphic in the universe level of its type argument.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Universes.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: poly_id$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: poly_id$\n\nThat is, the type of the identity function ``id`` is ``id_t`` or\n``a:Type u#i -> a -> a``---meaning, for all types ``a`` in\nuniverse ``Type u#i``, ``id a`` is function of type ``a -> a``.\n\nNow, ``id_t`` is itself a type in universe ``Type u#(i + 1)``, and\nsince the ``id`` function can be applied to types in any universe, it\ncan be applied to ``id_t`` too. So, it may look like this allows one\nto write functions that can be applied to themselves---which would be\nbad, since that would allow one to create infinite loops and break\nF*'s logic.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Universes.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: seemingly_self_application$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: seemingly_self_application$\n\nHowever, if we write out the universe levels explicitly, we see that\nactually we aren't really applying the ``id`` function to\nitself. Things are actually stratified, so that we are instead applying an\ninstance of ``id`` at universe ``u#(i + 1)`` to the instance of ``id``\nat universes ``u#i``.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Universes.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: stratified_application$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: stratified_application$\n\n\nOne intuition for what's happening here is that there are really\ninfinitely many instances of the F* type system nested within each\nother, with each instance forming a universe. Type-polymorphic\nfunctions (like ``id``) live in some universe ``u#(a + 1)`` and are\nparameterized over all the types in the immediately preceding universe\n``u#a``. The universe levels ensure that an F* function within\nuniverse level ``u#a`` cannot consume or produce terms that live in\nsome greater universe.\n\nUniverse level of an inductive type definition\n..............................................\n\nF* computes a universe level for inductive type definitions. To\ndescribe the rules for this in full generality, consider again the\ngeneral form of an inductive type definition, shown first :ref:`here\n<Part2_inductives>`, but this time with the universe level of each\ntype constructor made explicit, i.e., :math:`T_i` constructs a type in\nuniverse :math:`\\mathsf{Type~u\\#l_i}`\n\n.. math::\n\n   \\mathsf{type}~T_1~\\overline{(x_1:p_i)} : \\overline{y_1:q_1} \\rightarrow \\mathsf{Type}~u\\#l_1 = \\overline{\\bar D_1 : t_1} \\\\\n   \\mathsf{and}~T_n~\\\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>F*<|>ORGANIZATION<|>F* is a programming language designed to be a tool for software verification, allowing for universe polymorphism and type checking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TY_POLY<|>EVENT<|>Definition template in F* that is parameterized by a universe-variable ``a``, illustrating universe polymorphism)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ID<|>PERSON<|>Polymorphic identity function in F*, capable of being applied to types across different universe levels)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TY_POLY<|>F*<|>TY_POLY is a concept within F* that demonstrates its capability for universe polymorphism<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ID<|>F*<|>ID function is an example of F*'s support for type and universe polymorphism<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

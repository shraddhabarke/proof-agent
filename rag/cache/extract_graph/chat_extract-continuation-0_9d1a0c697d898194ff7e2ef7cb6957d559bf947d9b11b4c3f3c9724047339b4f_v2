So if p guarantees post , we can always weaken it\nto guarantee less, i.e. some post' where post ==> post' .\n\nThe rules of Floyd-Hoare logic provide an abstract way to reason about\nprograms. However, the rules of the logic are presented\ndeclaratively. For example, to apply the sequence rule, one has\nderive triples for each component in a way that they prove exactly the\nsame assertion ( pre_mid ) about the intermediate state. There may\nbe many ways to do this, e.g., one could apply the rule of\nconsequence to weaken the postcondition of the first component, or to\nstrengthen the precondition of the second component.\n\nDijkstraâ€™s system of weakest preconditions eliminates such ambiguity\nand provides an algorithm for computing valid Hoare triples,\nprovided the invariants of all loops are given. This makes weakest\npreconditions the basis of many program proof tools, since given a\nprogram annotated with loop invariants, one can simply compute a\nlogical formula (called a verification condition) whose validity\nimplies the correctness of the program.\n\nAt the core of the approach is a function WP (c, Q) , which\ncomputes a unique, weakest precondition P for the program c and postcondition Q . The semantics of WP is that WP (c, Q) is the weakest precondition that should hold before executing c for the postcondition Q to be valid after executing c . Thus,\nthe function WP assigns meaning to programs as a transformer of\npostconditions Q to preconditions WP (s, Q) .\n\nThe wp function for our small imperative language is shown below:\n\nlet rec wp (c:program) (post: state -> prop) \n  : state -> prop \n  = match c with\n    | Assign x e -> \n      fun s0 -> post (write s0 x (eval_expr e s0))\n      \n    | Seq p1 p2 ->\n      wp p1 (wp p2 post)\n\n    | If e p1 p2 -> \n      fun s0 -> \n        (eval_expr e s0 =!= 0 ==> wp p1 post s0) /\\\n        (eval_expr e s0 == 0  ==> wp p2 post s0)\n      \n    | Repeat e p ->\n      fun s0 ->\n        (exists (inv:state -> prop). \n          inv s0 /\\\n          (forall s. inv s ==> post s) /\\\n          (forall s. inv s ==> wp p inv s))\n\n\n- The case of Assign is identical to the assignment lemma\nshown earlier.\n\n- The case of Seq sequentially composes the wpâ€™s. That is, to\nprove the post after running p1 ;; p2 we need to prove wp p2 post after running p1 . It may be helpful to read this case\nas the equivalent form fun s0 -> wp p1 (fun s1 -> wp p2 post s1) s0 , where s0 is the initial state and s1 is the state that\nresults after running just p1 .\n\n- The If case computes the WPs for each branch and requires them\nto be proven under the suitable branch condition.\n\n- The Repeat case is most interesting: it involves an\nexistentially quantified invariant inv , which is the loop\ninvariant. That is, to reason about Repeat n p , one has to\nsomehow find an invariant inv that is true initially, and\nimplies both the WP of the loop body as well as the final\npostcondition.\n\nThe wp function is sound in the sense that it computes a\nsufficient precondition, as proven by the following lemma.\n\nlet rec wp_soundness (p:program) (post:state -> prop)\n  : Lemma (triple (wp p post) p post)\n  = match p with\n    | Assign x e -> ()\n    | Seq p1 p2 ->\n      wp_soundness p2 post;\n      wp_soundness p1 (wp p2 post)\n    | If e p1 p2 ->\n      wp_soundness p1 post;\n      wp_soundness p2 post\n    | Repeat e p ->\n      introduce forall s0. wp (Repeat e p) post s0 ==> \n                      post (snd (run (Repeat e p) s0)) with\n      introduce _ ==> _ with\n        _ . ( \n          eliminate exists (inv:state -> prop).\n                            inv s0 /\\                      \n                            (forall s. inv s ==> post s) /\\\n                            (forall s. inv s ==> wp p inv s)\n          returns _\n          with inv_props. (\n            wp_soundness p inv;\n            repeat e p inv\n          )\n      )\n\n\nOne could also prove that wp computes the weakest precondition,\ni.e., if triple p c q then forall s. p s ==> wp c q s , though\nwe do not prove that formally here.\n\nWe now illustrate some sample proofs using our Hoare triples and wp function. To emphasize that Hoare triples provide an abstract way of reasoning about the execution of programs, we define the hoare p c q an alias for triple p c q marked with an attribute\nto ensure that F* and Z3 cannot reason directly about the underlying\ndefinition of triple â€”that would allow Z3 to find proofs by\nreasoning about the operational semantics directly, which we want to\navoid , since it would not scale to larger programs.

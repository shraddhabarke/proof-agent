This\nillustrates how Pulse provides a separation logic on top of F*’s\nexisting dependent type system.\n\n- The invariant says that the counter never exceeds x ; the\naccumulator is always the product of counter and y ; and the\nloop continues so long as the counter is strictly less than x .\n\nThis next example shows a Pulse program that sums the first n natural numbers. It illustrates how Pulse programs can developed along\nwith pure F* specifications and lemmas.\n\nWe start with a specification of sum , a simple recursive function\nin F* along with a lemma that proves the well-known identity about\nthis sum.\n\nlet rec sum (n:nat)\n: nat\n= if n = 0 then 0 else n + sum (n - 1)\n\n#push-options \"--z3rlimit 20\"\nnoextract\nlet rec sum_lemma (n:nat)\n: Lemma (sum n == n * (n + 1) / 2)\n= if n = 0 then ()\n  else sum_lemma (n - 1)\n#pop-options\n\n\nNow, let’s say we want to implement isum , an iterative version of sum , and prove that it satisfies the identity proven by sum_lemma .\n\n#push-options \"--z3cliopt 'smt.arith.nl=false'\"\nnoextract\n```pulse\nfn isum (n:nat)\nrequires emp\nreturns z:nat\nensures pure ((n * (n + 1) / 2) == z)\n{\n    let mut acc : nat = 0;\n    let mut ctr : nat = 0;\n    while (\n        let c = !ctr;\n        (c < n)\n    )\n    invariant b.\n    exists* c a.\n        pts_to ctr c **\n        pts_to acc a **\n        pure (c <= n /\\\n              a == sum c /\\\n              b == (c < n))\n    {\n        let a = !acc;\n        let c = !ctr;\n        ctr := c + 1;\n        acc := a + c + 1;\n    };\n    sum_lemma n; //call an F* lemma inside Pulse\n    !acc;\n}\n```\n#pop-options\n\n\nThis program is quite similar to multiply_by_repeated_addition ,\nbut with a couple of differences:\n\n- The invariant says that the current value of the accumulator holds\nthe sum of the the first c numbers, i.e., we prove that the\nloop refines the recursive implementation of sum , without\nrelying on any properties of non-linear arithmetic—notice, we\nhave disabled non-linear arithmetic in Z3 with a pragma.\n\n- Finally, to prove the identity we’re after, we just call the F* sum_lemma that has already been proven from within Pulse, and\nthe proof is concluded.\n\nThe program is a bit artificial, but hopefully it illustrates how\nPulse programs can be shown to first refine a pure F* function, and\nthen to rely on mathematical reasoning on those pure functions to\nconclude properties about the Pulse program itself.\n\nPulse also supports general recursion, i.e., recursive functions that\nmay not terminate. Here is a simple example—we’ll see more examples\nlater.\n\nLet’s start with a standard F* (doubly) recursive definition that\ncomputes the nth Fibonacci number.\n\nlet rec fib (n:nat) : nat =\n  if n <= 1 then 1\n  else fib (n - 1) + fib (n - 2)\n\n\nOne can also implement it in Pulse, as fib_rec while using an\nout-parameter to hold that values of the last two Fibonacci numbers in\nthe sequence.\n\nfn rec fib_rec (n:pos) (out:ref (nat & nat))\nrequires\n    pts_to out 'v\nensures\n    exists* v.\n        pts_to out v **\n        pure (\n          fst v == fib (n - 1) /\\\n          snd v == fib n \n        )\n{\n  if ((n = 1))\n  {\n    //type inference in Pulse doesn't work well here:\n    //it picks (1, 1) to have type (int & int)\n    //so we have to annotate\n    out := ((1 <: nat), (1 <: nat)); \n  }\n  else\n  {\n    fib_rec (n - 1) out;\n    let v = !out;\n    out := (snd v, fst v + snd v);\n  }\n}\n\n\nSome points to note here:\n\n- Recursive definitions in Pulse are introduced with fn rec .\n\n- So that we can easily memoize the last two values of fib , we\nexpect the argument n to be a positive number, rather than\nalso allowing 0 .\n\n- A quirk shown in the comments: We need an additional type\nannotation to properly type (1, 1) as a pair\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PULSE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Pulse is a programming model that supports general recursion and separation logic on top of F*'s dependent type system)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>F*<|>ORGANIZATION<|>F* is a programming language designed for program verification, providing a dependent type system and support for pure mathematical reasoning)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REPEATED_ADDITION<|>EVENT<|>A Pulse program that multiplies two numbers by repeated addition, illustrating the use of separation logic and invariants in Pulse)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUM<|>EVENT<|>A recursive function in F* that calculates the sum of the first n natural numbers, along with a lemma proving a well-known identity about this sum)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ISUM<|>EVENT<|>An iterative version of the sum function in Pulse, designed to prove the same identity as sum_lemma by refining the recursive implementation of sum)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUM_LEMMA<|>EVENT<|>A lemma in F* that proves the identity of the sum function, illustrating the integration of F* mathematical reasoning into Pulse programs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FIB<|>EVENT<|>A recursive function in F* that computes the nth Fibonacci number, showcasing F*'s support for recursive definitions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FIB_REC<|>EVENT<|>A Pulse implementation of the Fibonacci sequence using an out-parameter to memoize the last two values, demonstrating Pulse's support for general recursion)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>REPEATED_ADDITION<|>PULSE<|>The repeated addition program is an example of how Pulse can be used to implement and verify algorithms<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SUM<|>F*<|>The sum function and its lemma are implemented and proven in F*, showcasing the language's capabilities for program verification<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ISUM<|>PULSE<|>Isum is an iterative version of sum implemented in Pulse, showing Pulse's ability to refine and prove properties about programs<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SUM_LEMMA<|>SUM<|>Sum_lemma proves a well-known identity about the sum function, linking mathematical reasoning with program verification in F*<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FIB<|>F*<|>The Fibonacci function is implemented in F* to demonstrate recursive definitions within the language<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FIB_REC<|>PULSE<|>Fib_rec is a Pulse implementation of the Fibonacci sequence, illustrating Pulse's support for recursion and memoization<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

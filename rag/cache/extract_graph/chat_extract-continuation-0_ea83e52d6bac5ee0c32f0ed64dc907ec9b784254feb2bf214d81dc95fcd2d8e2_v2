In this example, rather\nthan going via the indirection of the syntax of lambda terms, we show\nhow the type ``dyn`` can be used directly to embed within F* a small\nTuring complete, dynamically typed programming language.\n\nWe can start by lifting the F* operations on integers and functions to\n(possibly failing) operations on ``dyn``.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Divergence.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: lift_int$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: lift_int$\n\nWe also encode provide operations to compare dyn-typed integers and to\nbranch on them, treating ``0`` as ``false``.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Divergence.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: branch_eq$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: branch_eq$\n\nFor functions, we can provide combinators to apply functions and,\nimportantly, a combinator ``fix`` that provides general recursion.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Divergence.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: app_fix$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: app_fix$\n\nAn aside on the arity of recursive functions: You may wonder why\n``fix`` is defined as shown, rather than ``fix_alt`` below, which\nremoves a needless additional abstraction. The reason is that with\n``fix_alt``, to instruct F* to disable the termination checker on the\nrecursive definition, we need an additional ``Dv`` annotation: indeed,\nevaluating ``fixalt f`` in a call-by-value semantics would result,\nunconditionally, in an infinite loop, whereas ``fix f`` would\nimmediately return the lambda term ``fun n -> f (fix f) n``. In other\nwords, eta reduction (or removing redundant function applications)\ndoes not preserve semantics in the presence of divergence.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Divergence.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: fix_alt$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: fix_alt$\n                \nWith that, we can program non-trivial dynamically typed, general\nrecursive programs within F* itself, as seen below.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Divergence.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: collatz_dyn$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: collatz_dyn$\n\nAll of which is to illustrate that with general recursion and\nnon-positive datatypes using ``Dv``, F* is a general-purpose\nprogramming language like ML, Haskell, Lisp, or Scheme, or other\nfunctional languages you may be familiar with.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>DYN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Dyn is a type used in F* to represent dynamically typed programming constructs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>F*<|>ORGANIZATION<|>F* is a functional programming language designed for program verification)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DYN<|>F*<|>Dyn is a type within the F* programming language used for dynamic typing<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

Note, the effect of auto_reveal is GTot\n\n- auto_reveal_2 fails, since the the annotation claims,\nincorrectly, that the effect label is Tot\n\n- incr is just a nat -> nat function.\n\n- incr_e is interesting because it calls incr with an erased nat and the annotation expects an erased nat too. The body of incr_e is implicitly coerced to hide (incr (reveal x))\n\n- incr' is interesting, since it calls incr_e : its body\nis implicitly coerced to reveal (incr_e (hide x))\n\n- Finally, poly shows the limitations of implicit coercion: F*\nonly inserts coercions when the expected type of the term in a\ncontext and the type of the term differ by an erased constructor. In poly , since == is polymorphic, the expected\ntype of the context is just an unresolved unification variable and,\nso, no coercion is inserted. Instead, F* complains that y has\ntype erased nat when the type nat was expected.\n\nWe have already noted that Tot < GTot , enabling Tot computations to be re-used in GTot contexts. For erasure to be\nsound, it is crucial that GTot terms cannot be used in Tot contexts, and indeed, F* forbids this in general. However, there are\ntwo exceptions.\n\nConsider a term f with type GTot s , where s is a\nnon-informative type. Since s is non-informative, no total context\ncan extract any information from f . As such, F* allows implicitly\npromoting GTot s to Tot s , when s is a non-informative\ntype.\n\nFor instance, the following is derivable, hide (factorial 0) : Tot (erased nat) : let’s work through it in detail.\n\n- We know that that factorial n : GTot nat\n\n- Recall from the discussion on evaluation order and the application of functions to\neffectful arguments, hide (factorial 0) is equivalent to let x = factorial 0 in hide x , where x:nat and hide x : Tot (erased nat) .\n\n- From the rule for sequential composition of effectful terms, the\ntype of let x = factorial 0 in hide x should be GTot (erased nat) , since GTot = lub GTot Tot .\n\n- Since erased nat is a non-informative type, GTot (erased nat) is promoted to Tot (erased nat) , which is then the type\nof hide (factorial 0) .\n\nEffect promotion for ghost functions returning non-informative types\nis very useful. It allows one to mix ghost computations with total\ncomputations, so long as the result of the ghost sub-computation is\nhidden with an erased type. For instance, in the code below, we use hide (factorial (n - 1)) and use the result f_n_1 in an\nassertion to or some other proof step, all within a function that is\nin the Tot effect.\n\nlet rec factorial_tail_alt (n:nat) (out:nat)\n  : Tot (r:nat { r == out * factorial n })\n  = if n = 0 then out\n    else (\n      let f_n_1 = hide (factorial (n - 1)) in\n      let result = factorial_tail_alt (n - 1) (n * out) in\n      assert (result == (n * out) * f_n_1);\n      result\n    )\n\n\nConsider applying map factorial [0;1;2] , where map : (a -> Tot b) -> list a -> list b . F* refuses to typecheck this written,\nsince factorial : nat -> GTot nat , which is not a subtype of nat -> Tot nat .\n\nUsing effect promotion, one could write map (fun x -> hide (factorial x)) [0;1;2] , but this has type list (erased nat) ,\nwhich is not the same as list nat .\n\nThis is unfortunate since it seems that basic libraries designed for\nuse with with higher-order total functions cannot be reused with ghost\nfunctions. [ 2 ]\n\nThe library function FStar.Ghost.Pull.pull can help in such\nsituatinos. It has the following signature:\n\nval pull (#a:Type) (#b:a -> Type) (f: (x:a -> GTot (b x)))\n  : GTot (x:a -> b x)\n\nval pull_equiv (#a:Type) (#b:a -> Type) (f: (x:a -> GTot (b x))) (x:a)\n  : Lemma (ensures pull f x == f x)\n          [SMTPat (pull f x)]\n\n\nThis type states that for any ghost function f , we can exhibit a\ntotal function g with the same type as f , while the lemma pull_equiv states that g is pointwise equal to f . [ 3 ] However,\nit may not be possible, in general, to compute g in a way that\nenables it to be compiled by F*. So, pull f itself has ghost\neffect, indicating that applications of pull cannot be used in\ncompilable code.\n\nUsing pull , one can write map (pull factorial) [0;1;2] : GTot (list nat) , thereby reusing ghost functions where total functions\nare expected.\n\nF* does not have any built-in support for effect-label\npolymorphism. That is, one cannot write a type like this: map #a #b #e (f: a -> e b) (l:list a) : e (list b) , where e is an effect variable. However, using F*’s dependent types, one\ncan code up various ad\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>AUTO_REVEAL_2<|>EVENT<|>A failure event where the annotation incorrectly claims that the effect label is Tot)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INCR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A function that represents a natural number to natural number transformation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INCR_E<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A function that calls INCR with an erased natural number and expects an erased natural number in return)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INCR'<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A function that calls INCR_E and its body is implicitly coerced to reveal the result)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>POLY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Demonstrates the limitations of implicit coercion in F* where no coercion is inserted due to type expectation mismatch)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GTOT<|>EVENT<|>Represents a broader computational context in F* that allows for non-total computations)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TOT<|>EVENT<|>Represents a total computational context in F* where computations are guaranteed to terminate)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FACTORIAL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A function that calculates the factorial of a number, demonstrating effect promotion in F*)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FSTAR.GHOST.PULL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A library function in F* that allows ghost functions to be used where total functions are expected)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AUTO_REVEAL_2<|>GTOT<|>AUTO_REVEAL_2's failure is related to the misunderstanding of GTot's effect label<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INCR_E<|>INCR<|>INCR_E calls INCR with an erased natural number<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INCR'<|>INCR_E<|>INCR' calls INCR_E and its result is implicitly coerced<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>POLY<|>GTOT<|>POLY shows limitations in the context of GTot due to implicit coercion issues<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FACTORIAL<|>GTOT<|>FACTORIAL's computation is in the GTot context but can be promoted to Tot<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FSTAR.GHOST.PULL<|>FACTORIAL<|>FSTAR.GHOST.PULL enables the use of FACTORIAL in contexts expecting total functions<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

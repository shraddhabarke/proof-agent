Some variables are local to each thread, while others are shared among threads.\n\nA declaration can also initialize a variable to a given value:\n\nuint32 a = 3;\n\nShared variables are initialized when the hardware is reset. If no initial value is provided for a shared variable, then the initial value of that variable is undefined. For FPGA targets, memories are initialized only when the FPGA is programmed.\n\nLocal variables are initialized before the first use of the variable by the corresponding thread. If no initial value is provided for a local variable, all bits are initialized to zero.\n\n\nInitializer lists\n\nVariables can be initialized with initializer lists:\n\nuint32 a = {}; // initialized to 0\n\nstruct Flag\n{\n    bool b;\n}\n\nstruct S\n{\n    uint8 x;\n    int16 y;\n    Flag f;\n}\n\nS s1 = {3, 4, {true}}; // x = 3, y = 4, t.f.b = true\nS s2 = {3};            // x = 3, y = 0, t.f.b = false\n\nS Foo()\n{\n    // returns an S with x = 6, y = 7, t.f.b = true\n    return { 6, 7, {true} };\n}\n\nWhen an array or memory is initialized with an initializer list, the number of elements in the initializer list must be less than or equal to the number of elements in the the array or memory. If the initializer list contains fewer elements than the array or memory, then the remaining elements are initialized to 0.\n\n// This is the same as:\n// memory<uint32, 8> mem = { 3, 2, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 };\nmemory<uint32, 8> mem = { 3, 2, 5 };\n\nUnions can be initialized with an empty initializer list, or an initializer list with one element. If the initializer list contains one element, then the first field of the union is initialized to the specified value. Designated initializers (#designated-initializers) are recommended when initializing a union, because the name of the initialized field is explicitly specified in the source.\n\nunion U\n{\n    uint32 a;\n    uint16 b;\n}\n\nU u = { 0x12345678 }; // sets u.a = 0x12345678\n\n\nDesignated initializers\n\nDesignated initializers allow initializing instances of classes, structs, and unions.

In\nmany other dependently typed languages, exhibiting a term e : t is\nthe only way to prove that t is valid. In F*, while one can do\nsuch proofs, it is not the only way to prove a theorem.\n\nBy way of illustration, let’s think about Boolean refinement\ntypes . As we’ve seen already, it is\neasy to prove 17 : x:int{x >= 0} in F*. Under the covers, F*\nproves that (x >= 0) [17/x] reduces to true , yet no explicit\nterm is given to prove this fact. Instead, F* encodes facts about a\nprogram (including things like the semantics of arithmetic operators\nlike >= ) in the classical logic of an SMT solver and asks it (Z3\ntypically) to prove whether the formula 17 >= 0 is valid in a\ncontext including all encoded facts about a program. If Z3 is able to\nprove it valid, F* accepts the formula as true, without ever\nconstructing a term representing a proof of 17 >= 0 .\n\nThis design has many important consequences, including, briefly:\n\n- Trust: F* implicitly trusts its encoding to SMT logic and the\ncorrectness of the Z3 solver.\n\n- Proof irrelevance: Since no proof term is constructed for proofs\ndone by SMT, a program cannot distinguish between different proofs\nof a fact proven by SMT.\n\n- Subtyping: Since no proof term is constructed, a term like 17 can have many types, int , nat , x:int{x = 17} , etc. As\nmentioned earlier , F*\nleverages this to support refinement subtyping.\n\n- Undecidability: Since Z3 can check the validity of formulas in the\nentirety of its logic, including things like quantifying universally\nand existentially over infinite ranges, F* does not restrict the the\nformulas checked for validity by Z3 to be boolean, or even\ndecidable. Yes, typechecking in F* is undecidable.\n\nIn this chapter, we’ll learn about the the classical logic parts of\nF*, i.e., the parts that allow it to interface with an SMT solver.\n\nNote\n\nThe beginning of this chapter is a little technical, even though\nwe’re not telling the full story behind F*’s classical logic\nyet. If parts of it are hard to understand right now, here’s what\nyou need to know to before you jump ahead .\n\nF* let’s you write quantified formulas, called propositions, like\nso\n\nforall (x1:t1) ... (xn:tn). p\nexists (x1:t1) ... (xn:tn). p\n\n\nYou can build propositions from booleans and conjunctions,\ndisjunctions, negations, implications, and bi-implications:\n\np /\\ q   //conjunction\np \\/ q   //disjunction\n~p       //negation\np ==> q  //implication\np <==> q //bi-implication\n\n\nFor example, one can say (as shown below) that for all natural\nnumbers x and y , if the modulus x % y is 0 , then\nthere exists a natural number z such that x is z * y .\n\nforall (x:nat) (y:nat). x % y = 0 ==> (exists (z:nat). x = z * y)\n\n\nF* also has a notion of propositional equality, written == ,\nthat can be used to state that two terms of any type are equal. In\ncontrast, the boolean equality = can only be used on types that\nsupport decidable equality. For instance, for f1, f2 : int -> int , you can write f1 == f2 but you cannot write f1 = f2 ,\nsince two functions cannot be decidably compared for equality.\n\nThe type prop defined in Prims is F*’s type of\nproof-irrelevant propositions. More informally, prop is the type\ngiven to facts that are provable using the SMT solver’s classical\nlogic.\n\nPropositions defined in prop need not be decidable. For example,\nfor a Turing machine tm , the fact halts tm can be defined as a prop , although it is impossible to decide for an arbitrary tm whether tm halts on all inputs. This is contrast with bool ,\nthe type of booleans {true, false} . Clearly, one could not define halts tm as a bool , since one would be claiming that for halts is function that for any tm can decide (by returning\ntrue or false) whether or not tm halts on all inputs.\n\nF* will implicitly convert a bool to a prop when needed, since\na decidable fact can be turned into a fact that may be\nundecidable. But, when using propositions, one can define things that\ncannot be defined in bool , including quantified formulae, as we’ll\nsee next.\n\nConsider stating that factorial n always returns a positive\nnumber, when n:nat . In the previous section we\nlearned that one way to do this is to give factorial a type like so.\n\nval factorial (n:nat) : x:nat{x > 0}\n\n\nHere’s another way to state it:\n\nforall (n:nat). factorial n > 0\n\n\nWhat about stating that factorial n can sometimes return a value\nthat’s greater than n * n ?\n\nexists (n:nat). factorial n > n * n\n\n\nWe’ve just seen our first use of universal and existential\nquantifiers.\n\nA universal quantifier is constructed using the forall keyword.

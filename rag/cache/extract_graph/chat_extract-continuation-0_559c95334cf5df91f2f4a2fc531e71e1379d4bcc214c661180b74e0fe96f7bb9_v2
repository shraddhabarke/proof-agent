Another common example is to use monads to model\ncomputations that may raise runtime errors. Here’s an exercise to help\nyou see how.\n\nProve that the option type can be made into a monad, i.e., define bind and return and prove the monad laws.\n\nExercise file\n\nEach time one defines a monad to model a computational effect, one\nusually thinks first of the effectful actions involved (e.g.,\nreading and writing the state, or raising an error), and then finds a\nway to package those actions into the interface of monad with return and bind , and then, to keep things honest, proves that\nthe implementation satisfies the monad laws.\n\nHowever, a lot of this is boilerplate and can be done once and for all\nby representing effectful computations not just as functions (as we\ndid with st a = int -> a & s ) but instead as an inductive type\nthat models a computation tree , with effectful actions made explicit\nat each node in the tree. One can prove that this representation,\nsometimes called a free monad , is a monad, and then instantiate it\nrepeatedly for the particular kinds of actions that one may want to\nuse in given program.\n\nNote\n\nIn this section, we’re scratching the surface of a rich area of\nresearch called algebraic effects . While what we show here is not\na full-blown algebraic effects development (we’ll save that for a\nlater chapter), here are some other resources about it.\n\n- Alg.fst :\nAn F* development with algebraic effects (to be covered in\ndetail later).\n\n- Koka , a\nlanguage with algebraic effects at its core\n\n- A bibliography about effects\n\nWe’ll start our development of computation trees with a type\ndescribing the signature of a language of actions.\n\nnoeq\ntype action_class = {\n  t : Type;\n  input_of : t -> Type;\n  output_of : t -> Type;\n}\n\n\nThis kind of signature is sometimes called a type class , a type act:Type , together with some operations it supports. In this case,\nthe operations tell us what kind of input and output a given action\nexpects.\n\nNote\n\nF* also provides support for type classes and inference of type\nclass instantiations. This will be described in a later\nchapter. Meanwhile, you can learn more about type classes in F* from the wiki and from these examples .\n\nFor example, if we were interested in just the read/write actions on a\nmutable integer state (as in our st a example), we could build an\ninstance of the action_class , as shown below.\n\ntype rw =\n  | Read\n  | Write\n\nlet input_of : rw -> Type =\n  fun a ->\n    match a with\n    | Read -> unit\n    | Write -> int\n\nlet output_of : rw -> Type =\n  fun a ->\n    match a with\n    | Read -> int\n    | Write -> unit\n\nlet rw_action_class = { t = rw; input_of ; output_of }\n\n\nHowever, we can define a type tree acts a , the type of a computation\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ST<|>ORGANIZATION<|>ST is a type constructor used to model stateful computations in a functional programming context, allowing state to be passed and transformed through functions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>READ<|>EVENT<|>Read is an operation in the ST monad that retrieves the current state without modifying it)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WRITE<|>EVENT<|>Write is an operation in the ST monad that updates the state to a new value)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BIND<|>EVENT<|>Bind is a fundamental operation in monads that sequences computations, passing the result of one as the input to another)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RETURN<|>EVENT<|>Return is an operation in monads that injects a value into the monadic context, starting a monadic computation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>READ_AND_INCREMENT<|>EVENT<|>Read_and_increment is a specific computation in the ST monad that reads the current state, increments it, and returns the original state value)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INC_TWICE<|>EVENT<|>Inc_twice is a computation in the ST monad that applies the read_and_increment operation twice, effectively incrementing the state twice)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OPTION MONAD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Option monad is a monadic structure used to model computations that may fail or return a value, providing a way to chain such computations)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALGEBRAIC EFFECTS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Algebraic effects are a method of representing computational effects in a modular and composable way, using algebraic data types and operations)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ACTION_CLASS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Action_class represents a signature for actions in a computational context, defining input and output types for each action)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RW<|>ORGANIZATION<|>RW represents a set of read/write actions on a mutable integer state, used as an example of an action_class instance)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>READ<|>ST<|>Read operation is part of the ST monad's interface for stateful computations<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WRITE<|>ST<|>Write operation is part of the ST monad's interface for managing state<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIND<|>ST<|>Bind operation is essential for sequencing computations in the ST monad<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RETURN<|>ST<|>Return operation is used to inject values into the ST monad<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>READ_AND_INCREMENT<|>READ<|>Read_and_increment uses the Read operation as part of its computation<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>READ_AND_INCREMENT<|>WRITE<|>Read_and_increment involves a Write operation to update the state<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INC_TWICE<|>READ_AND_INCREMENT<|>Inc_twice performs the read_and_increment operation twice<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OPTION MONAD<|>BIND<|>Option monad utilizes Bind to sequence computations that may fail<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OPTION MONAD<|>RETURN<|>Option monad uses Return to handle successful computation results<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALGEBRAIC EFFECTS<|>ACTION_CLASS<|>Algebraic effects can be modeled using action_class to define computational actions<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RW<|>ACTION_CLASS<|>RW is an instance of action_class, representing read/write actions<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

[#]_ The label ``GTot`` is strictly above ``Tot`` in the\neffect hierarchy, i.e., ``Tot < GTot``. This means that a term with\ncomputation type ``GTot t`` cannot influence the behavior of a term\nwhose type is ``Tot s``. Conversely, every ``Tot`` computation can be\nimplicitly promoted to a ``GTot`` computation.\n\nGhost computations are just as well-behaved as pure, total\nterms---they always terminate on all inputs and exhibit no observable\neffects, except for the value they return. As such, F*'s logical core\nreally includes both ``Tot`` and ``GTot`` computations. The\ndistinction between ``Tot`` and ``GTot`` is only relevant when\nconsidering how programs are compiled. Ghost computations are\nguaranteed to be erased by the the compiler, while ``Tot``\ncomputations are retained.\n\nSince ``Tot`` terms are implicitly promoted to ``GTot``, it is easy to\ndesignate that some piece of code should be erased just by annotating\nit with a ``GTot`` effect label. For example, here is an ghost version\nof the factorial function:\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/FactorialTailRec.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: factorial$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: factorial$\n\nIts definition is identical to the corresponding total function that\nwe saw earlier, except that we have annotated the return computation\ntype of the function as ``GTot nat``. This indicates to F* that\n``factorial`` is to be erased during compilation, and the F*\ntype-and-effect checker ensures that ``Tot`` computation cannot depend\non an application of ``factorial n``.\n\n.. [#] The name ``GTot`` is meant to stand for \"Ghost and Total\"\n       computations, and is pronounced \"gee tote\". However, it's a\n       poor name and is far from self-explanatory. We plan to change\n       the name of this effect in the future (e.g., to something like\n       ``Spec``, ``Ghost``, or ``Erased``), though this is a breaking\n       change to a large amount of existing F* code.\n\nGhost Computations as Specifications\n------------------------------------\n\nA ghost function like ``factorial`` can be used in specifications,\ne.g., in a proof that a tail recursion optimization ``factorial_tail``\nis equivalent to ``factorial``.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/FactorialTailRec.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: factorial_tail$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: factorial_tail$\n\nThis type allows a client to use the more efficient ``fact``, but for\nreasoning purposes, one can use the more canonical ``factorial``,\nproven equivalent to ``fact``.\n\nIn contrast, if we were to try to implement the same specification by\ndirectly using the factorial ghost function, F* complains with a\neffect incompatibility error.\n      \n.. literalinclude:: ../code/FactorialTailRec.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: factorial_bad$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: factorial_bad$\n\nThe error is:\n\n.. code-block:: none\n\n   Computed type \"r: nat{r == out * factorial n}\" and\n   effect \"GTot\" is not compatible with the annotated\n   type \"r: nat{r == out * factorial n}\" effect \"Tot\"\n\nSo, while F* forbids using ghost computations in ``Tot`` contexts, it\nseems to be fine with accepting a use of factorial in specifications,\ne.g., in the type ``r:nat { r == out * factorial n }``. We'll see in a\nmoment why this is permitted.\n\nErasable and Non-informative Types\n----------------------------------\n\nIn addition to using the ``GTot`` effect to classifies computations\nthat must be erased, F* also provides a way to mark certain *value\ntypes* as erasable.\n\nConsider introducing an inductive type definition that is meant to\ndescribe a proof term only and for that proof term to introduce no\nruntime overhead. In a system like Coq, the type of Coq propositions\n``Prop`` serves this purpose, but ``prop`` in F* is quite\ndifferent. Instead, F* allows an inductive type definition to be\nmarked as ``erasable``.\n\nFor example, when we looked at the :ref:`simply typed lambda calculus\n(STLC) <Part2_stlc_typing>`, we introduced the inductive type below,\nto represent a typing derivation for an STLC term. One could define a\ntypechecker for STLC and give it the type shown below to prove it\ncorrect:\n\n.. code-block:: fstar\n\n   val check (g:env) (e:exp) : (t : typ & typing g e t)                \n\nHowever, this function returns both the type ``t:typ`` computed for\n``e``, we well as the typing derivation. Although the typing\nderivation may be useful in some cases, often returning the whole\nderivation is unnecessary. By marking the definition of the ``typing``\ninductive as shown below (and keeping the rest of the definition the\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>F*<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A programming language with an effect system that includes ghost computations, which are computations meant to be erased during compilation>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GTOT<|>EVENT<|>An effect label in F*'s effect system representing ghost computations that are guaranteed to be erased by the compiler>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TOT<|>EVENT<|>An effect label in F*'s effect system representing computations that are retained during compilation>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FACTORIAL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A ghost version of the factorial function in F*, annotated to be erased during compilation>)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GTOT<|>TOT<|>GTot is strictly above Tot in the effect hierarchy, indicating GTot computations cannot influence Tot computations<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FACTORIAL<|>F*<|>The factorial function is an example of a ghost computation in F*'s programming language<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

We’ll need to introduce two more common vprop ’s, starting with the “points-to” predicate:\n\n- pts_to x v asserts that the reference x points to a cell\nin the current state that holds the value v .\n\nvprop ’s can also be combined in various ways, the most common one\nbeing the “separating conjunction”, written ** in Pulse. [ 4 ]\n\n- p ** q , means that the state can be split into two disjoint fragments satisfying p and q , respectively. Alternatively,\none could read p ** q as meaning that one holds the\npermissions associated with both p and q separately in a\ngiven state. The ** operator satisfies the following laws: Commutativity: p ** q is equivalent to q ** p Associativity: p ** (q ** r) is equivalent to (p ** q) ** r Left and right unit: p ** emp is equivalent to p . Since ** is commutative, this also means that emp ** p is\nequivalent to p\n\n- Commutativity: p ** q is equivalent to q ** p\n\n- Associativity: p ** (q ** r) is equivalent to (p ** q) ** r\n\n- Left and right unit: p ** emp is equivalent to p . Since ** is commutative, this also means that emp ** p is\nequivalent to p\n\nNow, perhaps the defining characteristic of separation logic is how\nthe ** operator works in the program logic, via a key rule known\nas the frame rule. The rule says that if you can prove the Hoare\ntriple { p } c { n. q } , then, for any other f : vprop , you\ncan also prove { p ** f } c { n. q ** f } — f is often called\nthe “frame”. It might take some time to appreciate, but the frame rule\ncaptures the essence of local, modular reasoning. Roughly, it states\nthat if a program is correct when it only has permission p on the\ninput state, then it remains correct when run in a larger state and is\nguaranteed to preserve any property ( f ) on the part of the state\nthat it doesn’t touch.\n\nWith this in mind, let’s look again at the type of incr , which\nrequires permission only to x and increments it:\n\nfn incr (x:ref int)\nrequires pts_to x 'i\nensures pts_to x ('i + 1)\n{\n    let v = !x;\n    x := v + 1;\n}\n\n\nBecause of the frame rule, we can also call incr in a context like incr_frame below, and we can prove without any additional work\nthat y is unchanged.\n\nfn incr_frame (x y:ref int)\nrequires pts_to x 'i ** pts_to y 'j\nensures pts_to x ('i + 1) ** pts_to y 'j\n{\n   incr x;\n}\n\n\nIn fact, Pulse lets us use the frame rule with any f:vprop , and we\nget, for free, that incr x does not disturb f .\n\nfn incr_frame_any (x:ref int) (f:vprop)\nrequires pts_to x 'i ** f\nensures pts_to x ('i + 1) ** f\n{\n   incr x;\n}\n\n\nA point about the notation: The variable 'i is an implicitly bound\nlogical variable, representing the value held in the ref-cell x in\nthe initial state. In this case, 'i has type FStar.Ghost.erased int —we learned about erased types in a previous section . One can also bind logical variables explicitly, e.g.,\nthis is equivalent:\n\nfn incr_explicit_i (x:ref int) (i:erased int)\nrequires pts_to x i\nensures pts_to x (i + 1)\n{\n    let v = !x;\n    x := v + 1;\n}\n\n\nOther vprop connectives In addition the separating conjunction,\nPulse, like other separation logics, provides other ways to combine vprops . We’ll look at these in detail in the subsequent chapters,\nbut we list the most common other connectives below just to give you a\ntaste of the logic.\n\n- exists* (x1:t1) ... (xn:tn). p : Existential quantification is\nused extensively in the Pulse libraries, and the language provides\nmany tools to make existentials convenient to use. exists x. p is valid in a state s if there is a witness w such that p [w/x] is valid in s . For experts, existential\nquantification is impredicative, in the sense that one can quantify\nover vprops themselves, i.e., exists* (p:vprop). q is\nallowed.\n\n- forall* (x1:t1) ... (xn:tn). p : Universal quantification is\nalso supported, though less commonly used. forall (x:t). p is\nvalid in s if p[w/x] is valid for all values w:t .\nLike existential quantification, it is also impredicative.\n\n- p @==> q is a form of separating implication similar to an\noperator called a magic wand or a view shift in other\nseparation logics.\n\nPulse does not yet provide libraries for conjunction or\ndisjunction. However, since Pulse is embedded in F*, new vprops can\nalso be defined by the user and it is common to do so, e.g.,\nrecursively defined predicates, or variants of the connectives\ndescribed above.\n\nThey are called vprop for mostly historical reasons.

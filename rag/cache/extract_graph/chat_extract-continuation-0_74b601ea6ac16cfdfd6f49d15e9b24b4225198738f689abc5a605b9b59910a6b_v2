[ 1 ] That is, e requires and restores the invariant p ,\nwhile also transforming r to s x , all in at most one atomic\nstep. Further, the name_of_inv i must not be in the set j .\n\n- with_invariants i { e } has type stt_atomic t (add_inv i j) (inv i p ** r) (fun x -> inv i p ** s x) . That is, e gets to\nuse p for a step, and from the caller’s perspective, the context\nwas transformed from r to s , while the use of p is\nhidden.\n\n- Pay attention to the add_inv i j index on with_invariants : stt_atomic (or stt_ghost ) computation is indexed by\nthe names of all the invariants that it may open.\n\nLet’s look at a few examples to see how with_invariants works.\n\nAlternatively e may have type stt_ghost t j (p ** r) (fun x -> p ** s x) , in which case the entire with_invariants i { e } block has type stt_ghost t (add_inv i j) (inv i p ** r) (fun x -> inv i p ** s x) , i.e., one can open an invariant and use it\nin either an atomic or ghost context.\n\nIn the example below, given inv i (owns r) , we can atomically\nupdate a reference with a pre- and postcondition of emp .\n\natomic\nfn update_ref_atomic (r:ref U32.t) (i:iref) (v:U32.t)\nrequires inv i (owns r)\nensures inv i (owns r)\nopens (singleton i)\n{\n  with_invariants i {    //owns r\n     unfold owns;        //ghost step;  exists* u. pts_to r u\n     write_atomic r v;   //atomic step; pts_to r v\n     fold owns;          //ghost step;  owns r\n  }\n}\n\n\n- At the start of the with_invariants scope, we have owns r in\nthe context.\n\n- The ghost step unfold owns unfolds it to its definition.\n\n- Then, we do a single atomic action, write_atomic .\n\n- And follow it up with a fold owns , another ghost step.\n\n- The block within with_invariants i has type stt_atomic unit emp_inames (owns r ** emp) (fun _ -> owns r ** emp)\n\n- Since we opened the invariant i , the type of update_ref_atomic records this in the opens (singleton i) annotation; equivalently, the type is stt_atomic unit (singleton i) (inv i (owns r)) (fun _ -> inv i (owns r)) . When the opens annotation is omitted, it defaults to emp_inames , the\nempty set of invariant names.\n\nTo see why we have to track the names of the opened invariants,\nconsider the example below. If we opened the same invariant twice\nwithin the same scope, then it’s easy to prove False :\n\n[@@expect_failure]\n```pulse\nfn double_open_bad (r:ref U32.t) (i:inv (owns r))\nrequires emp\nensures pure False\n{\n    with_invariants i {\n      with_invariants i {\n        unfold owns;\n        unfold owns;\n        pts_to_dup_impossible r;\n        fold owns;\n        fold owns\n      }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n\nHere, we open the invariants i twice and get owns r ** owns r ,\nor more than full permission to r —from this, it is easy to build\na contradiction.\n\nAtomic computations can be silently converted to regular, stt computations, while forgetting which invariants they opened. For\nexample, update_ref below is not marked atomic, so its type\ndoesn’t record which invariants were opened internally.\n\nfn update_ref (r:ref U32.t) (i:iref) (v:U32.t)\nrequires inv i (owns r)\nensures inv i (owns r)\n{                    \n  with_invariants i {    //owns r\n     unfold owns;        //ghost step;  exists* u. pts_to r u\n     write_atomic r v;   //atomic step; pts_to r v\n     fold owns;          //ghost step;  owns r\n  }\n}\n\n\nThis is okay, since a non-atomic computation can never appear within a with_invariants block—so, there’s no fear of an stt computation causing an unsound double opening. Attempting to use a\nnon-atomic computation in a with_invariants block produces an\nerror, as shown below.\n\n[@@expect_failure]\n```pulse \nfn update_ref_fail (r:ref U32.t) (i:iref) (v:U32.t)\nrequires inv i (owns r)\nensures inv i (owns r)\n{\n  with_invariants i {\n    unfold owns;\n    r := v; //not atomic\n    fold owns;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n\n- This computation is not atomic nor ghost. `with_invariants`\n  blocks can only contain atomic computations.\n\n\n© Copyright 2020, Microsoft Research.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>STT_ATOMIC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A type of computation that requires and restores invariants in at most one atomic step)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STT_GHOST<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A type of computation that can open an invariant and use it in either an atomic or ghost context)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UPDATE_REF_ATOMIC<|>EVENT<|>An atomic function that updates a reference with a pre- and postcondition, involving opening an invariant)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UPDATE_REF<|>EVENT<|>A non-atomic function that updates a reference without recording which invariants were opened internally)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WITH_INVARIANTS<|>EVENT<|>A block that allows the use of an invariant for a step, transforming the context while hiding the use of the invariant)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STT_ATOMIC<|>WITH_INVARIANTS<|>STT_ATOMIC computations can be used within with_invariants blocks<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STT_GHOST<|>WITH_INVARIANTS<|>STT_GHOST computations can also be used within with_invariants blocks, allowing the opening of invariants<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>UPDATE_REF_ATOMIC<|>STT_ATOMIC<|>UPDATE_REF_ATOMIC is an example of an atomic computation that involves opening an invariant<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>UPDATE_REF<|>STT_ATOMIC<|>UPDATE_REF is related to STT_ATOMIC as it is derived from atomic computations but does not record opened invariants<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WITH_INVARIANTS<|>UPDATE_REF_ATOMIC<|>WITH_INVARIANTS block is used in UPDATE_REF_ATOMIC to handle invariants<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WITH_INVARIANTS<|>UPDATE_REF<|>WITH_INVARIANTS block is used in UPDATE_REF, showing its application outside atomic contexts<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

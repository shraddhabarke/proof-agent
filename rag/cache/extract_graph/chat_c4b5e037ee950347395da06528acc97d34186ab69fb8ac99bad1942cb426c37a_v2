A module’s interface is a\nsubset of the module’s declarations and definitions. Another module Client that uses M can only make use of the part of M revealed in its interface—the rest of M is invisible to Client . As such, interfaces provide an abstraction mechanism,\nenabling the development of Client to be independent of any\ninterface-respecting implementation of M .\n\nUnlike module systems in other ML-like languages (which provide more\nadvanced features like signatures, functors, and first-class modules),\nF*’s module system is relatively simple.\n\n- A module can have at most one interface.\n\n- An interface can have at most one implementation.\n\n- A module lacking an interface reveals all its details to clients.\n\n- An interface lacking an implementation can be seen as an assumption or an axiom.\n\nTypeclasses : Typeclasses cater to more complex abstraction\npatterns, e.g., where an interface may have several\nimplementations. Many other languages, ranging from Haskell to Rust,\nsupport typeclasses that are similar in spirit to what F* also\nprovides.\n\nTypeclasses in F* are actually defined mostly by a “user-space”\nmetaprogam (relying on general support for metaprogramming in Meta-F* ), making them very\nflexible (e.g., multi-parameter classes, overlapping instances,\netc. are easily supported).\n\nThat said, typeclasses are a relatively recent addition to the\nlanguage and most of F*’s standard library does not yet use\ntypeclasses. As such, they are somewhat less mature than interfaces\nand some features require encodings (e.g., typeclass inheritance),\nrather than being supported with built-in syntax.\n\nThanks especially to Guido Martinez, who designed and implemented\nmost of F*’s typeclass system.\n\nContents:\n\n- Interfaces\n\n- Typeclasses\n\n© Copyright 2020, Microsoft Research.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_c4b5e037ee950347395da06528acc97d34186ab69fb8ac99bad1942cb426c37a_v2"}

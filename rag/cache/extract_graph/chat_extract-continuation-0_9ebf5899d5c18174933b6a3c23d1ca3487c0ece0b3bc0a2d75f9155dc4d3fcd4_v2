In this case, we\ncan solve the goal (without Z3) by calling ``trivial()``, a helper\ntactic that discharges trivial goals (such as trivial equalities).\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Part5.Pow2.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: pow2_4\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: pow2_4\n\nIf you ``dump`` the state just after the ``trivial()`` call, you should\nsee no more goals remain (this is what ``qed()`` checks).\n\n.. note::\n   \n  Meta-F* does not yet allow a fully interactive style of proof, and\n  hence we need to re-check the entire proof after every edit. We hope\n  to improve this soon.\n  \nThere is still the \"rest\" of the proof, namely that ``pow2 x < 1000000``\ngiven the hypothesis and the fact that the assertion holds. We call\nthis *skeleton* of the proof, and it is (by default) not handled by\nMeta-F*. In general, we only use tactics on those assertions that are\nparticularly hard for the SMT solver, but leave all the rest to it.\n\nThe ``Tac`` effect\n-------------------\n\n.. note:: \n\n   Although we have seen a bit about :ref:`monads and computational\n   effects in a previous chapter <Part2_par>`, we have yet to fully\n   describe F*'s effect system. So, some of what follows may be a bit\n   confusing. However, you don't need to fully understand how the\n   ``Tac`` effect is implemented to use tactics. Feel free to skip\n   ahead, if this section doesn't make much sense to you.\n\nWhat, concretely, are tactics? So far we've written a few simple ones,\nwithout too much attention to their structure.\n\nTactics and metaprograms in F* are really just F* terms, but *in a\nparticular effect*, namely ``Tac``. To construct interesting\nmetaprograms, we have to use the set of *primitives* provided by Meta-F*.\nTheir full list is in the ``FStar.Tactics.Builtins`` module.\nSo far, we have actually not used any primitive directly, but\nonly *derived* metaprograms present in the standard library.\n\nInternally, ``Tac`` is implemented via a combination of 1) a state\nmonad, over a ``proofstate``, 2) exceptions and 3) divergence or\nnon-termination.  The state monad is used to implicitly carry the\nproofstate, without us manually having to handle all goals\nexplicitly. Exceptions are a useful way of doing error handling. Any\ndeclared exception can be ``raise``'d within a metaprogram, and the\n``try..with`` construct works exactly as for normal programs. There\nare also ``fail``, ``catch`` and ``recover`` primitives.\n\nMetaprograms cannot be run directly. This is needed to retain the\nsoundness of pure computations, in the same way that stateful and\nexception-raising computations are isolated from the ``Pure`` fragment\n(and from each other). Metaprograms can only be used where F* expects\nthem , such as in an ``assert..by`` construct. Here, F* will run the\nmetaprogram on an initial proofstate consisting (usually) of a single\ngoal, and allow the metaprogram to modify it.\n\nTo guarantee soundness, i.e., that metaprograms do not prove false\nthings, all of the primitives are designed to perform small and\ncorrect modifications of the goals. Any metaprogram constructed from\nthem cannot do anything to the proofstate (which is abstract) except\nmodifying it via the primitives.\n\nHaving divergence as part of the ``Tac`` effect may seem a bit odd,\nsince allowing for diverging terms usually implies that one can form a\nproof of false, via a non-well-founded recursion. However, we should\nnote that this possible divergence happens at the *meta* level. If we\ncall a divergent tactic, F* will loop forever waiting for it to finish,\nnever actually accepting the assertion being checked.\n\nAs you know, F* already has exceptions and divergence. All ``Dv`` and\n``Ex`` functions can readily be used in Meta-F* metaprograms, as well as\nall ``Tot`` and ``Pure`` functions. For instance, you can use all of the\n``FStar.List.Tot`` module if your metaprogram uses lists.\n\nGoals\n-----\n\nEssentially, a Meta-F* tactic manipulates a *proofstate*, which is\nessentially a set of *goals*. Tactic primitives usually work on the\ngoals, for example by simplifying (like ``compute()``) or by breaking\nthem down into smaller *sub*-goals.\n\nWhen proving assertions, all of our goals will be of the shape ``squash\nphi``, where ``phi`` is some logical formula we must prove. One way to\nbreak down a goal into subparts is by using the ``mapply`` tactic, which\nattempts to prove the goal by instantiating the given lemma or function,\nperhaps adding subgoals for the hypothesis and arguments of the lemma.\nThis \"working backwards\" style is very common in tactics frameworks.\n\nFor instance, we could have proved the assertion that ``pow2 x <= pow2 19``\nin the following way:\n\n.. code-block:: fstar\n\n    assert (pow2 x <= pow2 19\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>META-F*<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Meta-F* is a framework within F* for writing metaprograms, including tactics for theorem proving)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FSTAR.TACTICS.BUILTINS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A module in F* that provides primitives for constructing metaprograms)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TAC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An effect in F* used for constructing metaprograms and tactics)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>POW2<|>EVENT<|>An example used in the text to demonstrate how to prove assertions using tactics in F*)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>META-F*<|>FSTAR.TACTICS.BUILTINS<|>Meta-F* utilizes the primitives provided by the FStar.Tactics.Builtins module for constructing metaprograms<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TAC<|>META-F*<|>Tactics and metaprograms in F* are constructed in the Tac effect, as part of Meta-F*<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>POW2<|>TAC<|>The example of proving an assertion about pow2 demonstrates the use of the Tac effect in tactics<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

This function cannot be defined when y is zero,\nbut it can be defined partially, by excluding the case where y = 0 , as shown below. (Of course, one can also refine the domain of the\nfunction to forbid y = 0 , but we’re just trying to illustrate the option type here.)\n\nlet try_divide (x y:int)\n  : option int\n  = if y = 0 then None else Some (x / y)\n\nlet divide (x:int) (y:int{y<>0}) = x / y\n\n\nLike most other functional languages, F* does not have a null value. Whenever a value may possibly be null , one typically uses\nthe option type, using None to signify null and Some v for\nthe non-null case.\n\nFStar.Pervasives also defines the either type, shown below.\n\ntype either a b =\n  | Inl : v: a -> either a b\n  | Inr : v: b -> either a b\n\n\nThe type either a b represents a value that could either be Inl v with v:a , or Inr v with v:b . That is, either a b is a tagged union of the a and b . It’s easy to write functions\nto analyze the tag Inl (meaning it’s “in the left case”) or Inr (“in the right case”) and compute with the underlying\nvalues. Here’s an example:\n\nlet same_case #a #b #c #d (x:either a b) (y:either c d)\n  : bool\n  = match x, y with\n    | Inl _, Inl _\n    | Inr _, Inr _ -> true\n    | _ -> false\n\nlet sum (x:either bool int) (y:either bool int{same_case x y})\n  : z:either bool int{ Inl? z <==> Inl? x}\n  = match x, y with\n    | Inl xl, Inl yl -> Inl (xl || yl)\n    | Inr xr, Inr yr -> Inr (xr + yr)\n\n\nThe same_case x y function decides if the two unions are both\nsimultaneously in the left or right case.\n\nThen, in sum x y , with a refinement that x and y are in\nthe same case, we can handle just two cases (when they are both in\nleft, or both in right) and F* can prove that the case analysis is\nexhaustive. In the left case, the underlying values are boolean, so we\ncombine them with || ; in the right case, the underlying values are\nintegers, so we combine them with + ; and return them with the\nappropriate tag. The type of the result z:either bool int{ Inl? z <==> Inl? x} shows that the result has the same case as x (and hence\nalso y ). We could have written the result type as z:either bool int { same_case z x } .\n\nAll the types we’ve see far have been inductive only in a degenerate\nsense—the constructors do not refer to the types they construct. Now,\nfor our first truly inductive type, a list.\n\nHere’s the definition of list from Prims :\n\ntype list a =\n  | Nil  : list a\n  | Cons : hd:a -> tl:list a -> list a\n\n\nThe list type is available implicitly in all F* programs and we\nhave special (but standard) syntax for the list constructors:\n\n- [] is Nil\n\n- [v1; ...; vn] is Cons v1 ... (Cons vn Nil)\n\n- hd :: tl is Cons hd tl .\n\nYou can always just write out the constructors like Nil and Cons explicitly, if you find that useful (e.g., to partially apply Cons hd : list a -> list a ).\n\nLet’s write some simple functions on lists, starting with computing\nthe length of a list.\n\nlet rec length #a (l:list a)\n  : nat\n  = match l with\n    | [] -> 0\n    | _ :: tl -> 1 + length tl\n\n\nThe length function is recursive and implicitly polymorphic in a\ntype a . For any list l : list a , length l returns a nat . The definition pattern matches on the list and calls length recursively on the tail of list, until the [] case is\nreached.\n\nClick here for the exercise file.\n\nHere’s the definition of append , a function that concatenates two\nlists. Can you give it a type that proves it always returns a list\nwhose length is the sum of the lengths of its arguments?\n\nlet rec append l1 l2\n  = match l1 with\n    | [] -> l2\n    | hd :: tl -> hd :: append tl l2\n\n\nAnswer\n\nval append (#a:Type) (l1 l2:list a)\n  : l:list a { length l = length l1 + length l2 }\n\n\n© Copyright 2020, Microsoft Research.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>F*<|>ORGANIZATION<|>F* is a functional programming language that emphasizes program verification, offering features like the option and either types to handle cases of potential null values and tagged unions, respectively)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OPTION TYPE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>In F*, the option type is used to represent values that may either be null (None) or have a value (Some v), avoiding the use of null values)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EITHER TYPE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The either type in F* represents a tagged union that can hold a value of either one type or another, facilitating functions that operate on such unions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LIST<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The list type in F* is an inductive type used to represent sequences of elements, with constructors for empty lists (Nil) and non-empty lists (Cons))\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OPTION TYPE<|>F*<|>The option type is a feature provided by F* to handle nullable values in a safe manner<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EITHER TYPE<|>F*<|>The either type is a construct in F* used for representing values that could be of one type or another, showcasing F*'s capability to handle tagged unions<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LIST<|>F*<|>The list type is an intrinsic part of F*, demonstrating the language's support for inductive types and recursive functions<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

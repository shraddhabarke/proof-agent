For example,\nwhy is it safe to call L.hd to access the first element of hashes ?\n\nNow, we can prove our main correctness theorem, namely that get_with_evidence returns a resource with verifiable\nevidence.\n\n// Correctness theorem: \n//\n// Using get_with_evidence's with compute_root_hash correctly\n// reconstructs the root hash\nlet rec correctness (#h:hash_t)\n                    (rid:resource_id)\n                    (tree:mtree (L.length rid) h)\n  : Lemma (ensures (verify (get_with_evidence rid tree) tree))\n          (decreases rid)\n  = match rid with\n    | [] -> ()\n    | bit::rid' ->\n      let N left right = tree in\n      if bit then\n\tcorrectness rid' left\n      else\n\tcorrectness rid' right\n\n\nThe proof is a simple proof by induction on the height of the tree, or\nequivalently, the length of the resource id.\n\nIn other words, evidence constructed by a honest prover is accepted by\nour verifier.\n\nThe main security theorem associated with this construction is the\nfollowing: if the verifier can be convinced to accept a resource with\nevidence of the form RES r rid hs , and if the resource in the\nMerkle tree associated with rid is not r , then we can easily\nconstruct a collision on the underlying cryptographic hash. Since the\nhash is meant to be collision resistant, one should conclude that it\nis at least as hard to convince our verifier to accept incorrect\nevidence as it is to find collisions on the underlying hash.\n\nWe start by defining the type of a hash_collision , a pair of\ndistinct strings that hash to the same value.\n\ntype hash_collision =\n  | Collision :\n      s1:string ->\n      s2:string {hash s1 = hash s2 /\\ not (s1 = s2)} ->\n      hash_collision\n\n\nThe security theorem shown below takes a tree and p:resource_with_evidence n , where the refinement on p states\nthat the verifier accepts the evidence ( verify p tree ) although\nthe resource associated with p.ri is not p.res : in this case,\nwe can build a function, by induction on the height of the tree, that\nreturns a hash collision.\n\n(* \n * If [verify] can be tricked into accepting the evidence of [p] when\n * [p.res] is not actually present in the tree at [p.ri], then\n * we can exhibit a hash collision\n *)\nlet rec security (#n:nat) (#h:hash_t)\n                 (tree:mtree n h)\n                 (p:resource_with_evidence n {\n                   verify p tree /\\\n                   not (get p.ri tree = p.res)\n                 })\n  : hash_collision\n  = match p.ri with\n    | [] -> Collision p.res (L?.res tree)\n    | bit::rid' ->\n      let N #_ #h1 #h2 left right = tree in\n      let h' = compute_root_hash (tail p) in\n      let hd :: _ = p.hashes in\n      if bit then\n\tif h' = h1 then\n\t  security left (tail p)\n\telse (\n          String.concat_injective h1 h' h2 hd;\n          Collision (concat h1 h2) (concat h' hd)\n        )\n      else\n\tif h' = h2 then\n\t  security right (tail p)\n\telse (\n          String.concat_injective h1 hd h2 h';\n\t  Collision (concat h1 h2) (concat hd h')\n        )\n\n\nWe look at its cases in detail:\n\n- In the base case, itâ€™s easy to construct a hash collision\ndirectly from the differing resources.\n\n- Otherwise, we recompute the hash associate with the current node\nfrom the tail of the evidence presented, and the two cases of the\nleft and right subtrees are symmetric. If the recomputed hash matches the hash of the node, then we\ncan generate a collision just by the induction hypothesis on\nthe left or right subtree. Otherwise, we can build a hash collision, relying on String.concat_injective , a lemma from the library stating\nthat the concatenation of two pairs of equal length strings are\nequal only if their components are. Knowing that h' <> h1 (or, symmetically, h' <> h2 ) this allows us to prove that\nthe concatenations are unequal, although their hashes are,\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>COMPUTE_ROOT_HASH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A function that computes the root hash of a resource based on its evidence and path within a Merkle tree)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HASH_COLLISION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A type representing a pair of distinct strings that hash to the same value, indicating a collision in the cryptographic hash function)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MERKLE TREE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A data structure used for efficiently proving the integrity and authenticity of the contents of a dataset)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RESOURCE_WITH_EVIDENCE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A type that includes a resource, its path, and the hashes needed to verify its presence in a Merkle tree)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VERIFY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A function that checks if the evidence provided for a resource's presence in a Merkle tree is valid)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COMPUTE_ROOT_HASH<|>RESOURCE_WITH_EVIDENCE<|>COMPUTE_ROOT_HASH function operates on RESOURCE_WITH_EVIDENCE to compute its root hash<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VERIFY<|>RESOURCE_WITH_EVIDENCE<|>VERIFY function checks the validity of RESOURCE_WITH_EVIDENCE against a Merkle tree<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HASH_COLLISION<|>COMPUTE_ROOT_HASH<|>If COMPUTE_ROOT_HASH leads to incorrect evidence being accepted, a HASH_COLLISION can be demonstrated<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RESOURCE_WITH_EVIDENCE<|>MERKLE TREE<|>RESOURCE_WITH_EVIDENCE is verified against a MERKLE TREE structure<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

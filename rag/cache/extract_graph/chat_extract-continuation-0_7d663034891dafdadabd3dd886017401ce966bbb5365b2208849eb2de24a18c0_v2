These\ntypes are called inductive types , or, more informally,\ndatatypes. We’ll also learn how to define functions over these\ninductive types by pattern matching and to prove properties about\nthem.\n\nNote\n\nWe’ll only cover the most basic forms of inductive types here. In\nparticular, the types we show here will not make use of indexing or\nany other form of dependent types—we’ll leave that for a later\nchapter.\n\nWe’ve seen that unit is the type with just one element () and\nthat bool is the type with two elements, true and false .\n\nYou can define your own types with an enumeration of elements, like so.\n\ntype three =\n  | One_of_three : three\n  | Two_of_three : three\n  | Three_of_three : three\n\n\nThis introduces a new type three : Type , and three distinct constants One_of_three : three , Two_of_three : three , Three_of_three : three . These constants are also called\n“constructors” or “data constructors”. The name of a constructor must\nbegin with an uppercase letter.\n\nNote\n\nIn this case, it may seem redundant to have to write the type of\neach constructor repeatedly—of course they’re all just constructors\nof the type three . In this case, F* will allow you to just\nwrite\n\ntype three =\n  | One_of_three\n  | Two_of_three\n  | Three_of_three\n\n\nAs we start to use indexed types, each constructor can build a\ndifferent instance of the defined type, so it will be important to\nhave a way to specify the result type of each constructor. For\nuniformity, throughout this book, we’ll always annotate the types\nof constructors, even when not strictly necessary.\n\nF* can prove that they are distinct and that these are the only terms\nof type three .\n\nlet distinct = assert (One_of_three <> Two_of_three /\\\n                       Two_of_three <> Three_of_three /\\\n                       Three_of_three <> One_of_three)\n\nlet exhaustive (x:three) = assert (x = One_of_three \\/\n                                   x = Two_of_three \\/\n                                   x = Three_of_three)\n\n\nTo write functions that case analyze these new types, one uses the match construct. The syntax of match in F* is very similar to\nOCaml or F#. We’ll assume that you’re familiar with its basics. As we\ngo, we’ll learn about more advanced ways to use match .\n\nHere are some examples.\n\nlet is_one (x:three)\n  : bool\n  = match x with\n    | One_of_three -> true\n    | _ -> false\n\nlet is_two (x:three)\n  : bool\n  = match x with\n    | Two_of_three -> true\n    | _ -> false\n\nlet is_three (x:three)\n  : bool\n  = match x with\n    | Three_of_three -> true\n    | _ -> false\n\n\nThese functions test whether x : three matches a given\nconstructor, returning a bool in each case. Since it’s so common\nto write functions that test whether a value of an inductive type\nmatches one of its constructors, F* automatically generates these\nfunctions for you. For example, instead of writing\n\nlet three_as_int (x:three)\n  : int\n  = if is_one x then 1\n    else if is_two x then 2\n    else 3\n\n\nOne can write:\n\nlet three_as_int' (x:three)\n  : int\n  = if One_of_three? x then 1\n    else if Two_of_three? x then 2\n    else 3\n\n\nIn other words, for every constructor T of an inductive type t , F* generates a function named T? (called a “discriminator”)\nwhich tests if a v:t matches T .\n\nOf course, an even more direct way of writing three_as_int is\n\nlet three_as_int'' (x:three)\n  : int\n  = match x with\n    | One_of_three -> 1\n    | Two_of_three -> 2\n    | Three_of_three -> 3\n\n\nEvery time you use a match , F* will make sure to prove that you\nare handling all possible cases. Try omitting one of the cases in three_as_int above and see what happens.\n\nExhaustiveness checking in F* is a semantic check and can use the SMT\nsolver to prove that all cases are handled appropriately. For example,\nyou can write this:\n\nlet only_two_as_int (x:three { not (Three_of_three? x) })\n  : int\n  = match x with\n    | One_of_three -> 1\n    | Two_of_three -> 2\n\n\nThe refinement on the argument allows F* to prove that the Three_of_three case in the pattern is not required, since that\nbranch would be unreachable anyway.\n\nThe next step from enumerations is to define composite types, e.g.,\ntypes that are made from pairs, triples, quadruples, etc. of other\ntypes. Here’s how\n\ntype tup2 (a:Type)  (b:Type) =\n  | Tup2 : fst:a -> snd:b -> tup2 a b\n\ntype tup3 a b c =\n  | Tup3 : fst:a -> snd:b -> thd:c -> tup3 a b c\n\n\nThe type definition for tup2 a b states that for any types a : Type and b : Type , Tup2 : a -> b -> tup2 a b . That is, Tup2 is a constructor of tup2 , such that given x:a and y:b , Tup2 x y : tup2 a b .\n\nThe other types tup3 and tup4\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>F*<|>ORGANIZATION<|>F* is a programming language that allows for defining inductive types, pattern matching, and proving properties about them)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INDUCTIVE TYPES<|>EVENT<|>Inductive types, or datatypes, are a way to define new types in F* by enumerating elements and using pattern matching to define functions over these types)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PATTERN MATCHING<|>EVENT<|>Pattern matching in F* is used to define functions over inductive types and to prove properties about them)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THREE<|>EVENT<|>An example of an inductive type defined in F* that includes three distinct constants: One_of_three, Two_of_three, Three_of_three)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TUP2<|>EVENT<|>A composite type in F* that represents a pair of any two types)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TUP3<|>EVENT<|>A composite type in F* that represents a triple of any three types)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INDUCTIVE TYPES<|>PATTERN MATCHING<|>Pattern matching is a technique used to define functions over inductive types in F*<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THREE<|>INDUCTIVE TYPES<|>Three is an example of an inductive type defined in F*<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TUP2<|>INDUCTIVE TYPES<|>Tup2 is a composite type, an example of using inductive types to define pairs<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TUP3<|>INDUCTIVE TYPES<|>Tup3 is a composite type, showcasing the use of inductive types to define triples<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

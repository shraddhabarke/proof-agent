I.e., define ``st (s:Type) (a:Type) : Type``, where ``s`` is\nthe type of the state.\n\nAdapt the full development seen above to work with ``st s``, including\nproving the various laws.\n\n`Exercise file <../code/exercises/Part2.ST.fst>`__\n\n.. container:: toggle\n\n    .. container:: header\n\n       **Answer**\n\n    .. literalinclude:: ../code/Part2.ST.fst\n       :language: fstar\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nExercise\n--------\n\nMonads can be used to model many computational effects, not just\nmutable state.  Another common example is to use monads to model\ncomputations that may raise runtime errors. Here's an exercise to help\nyou see how.\n\nProve that the ``option`` type can be made into a monad, i.e., define\n``bind`` and ``return`` and prove the monad laws.\n\n`Exercise file <../code/exercises/Part2.Option.fst>`__\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nComputation Trees, or Monads Generically\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nEach time one defines a monad to model a computational effect, one\nusually thinks first of the effectful *actions* involved (e.g.,\nreading and writing the state, or raising an error), and then finds a\nway to package those actions into the interface of monad with\n``return`` and ``bind``, and then, to keep things honest, proves that\nthe implementation satisfies the monad laws.\n\nHowever, a lot of this is boilerplate and can be done once and for all\nby representing effectful computations not just as functions (as we\ndid with ``st a = int -> a & s``) but instead as an inductive type\nthat models a *computation tree*, with effectful actions made explicit\nat each node in the tree. One can prove that this representation,\nsometimes called a *free monad*, is a monad, and then instantiate it\nrepeatedly for the particular kinds of actions that one may want to\nuse in given program.\n\n.. note ::\n\n  In this section, we're scratching the surface of a rich area of\n  research called *algebraic effects*. While what we show here is not\n  a full-blown algebraic effects development (we'll save that for a\n  later chapter), here are some other resources about it.\n\n    * `Alg.fst\n      <https://github.com/FStarLang/FStar/blob/master/examples/layeredeffects/Alg.fst>`_:\n      An F* development with algebraic effects (to be covered in\n      detail later).\n\n    * `Koka <https://koka-lang.github.io/koka/doc/index.html>`_, a\n      language with algebraic effects at its core\n\n    * A bibliography about `effects\n      <https://github.com/yallop/effects-bibliography>`_\n\nWe'll start our development of computation trees with a type\ndescribing the signature of a language of actions.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Part2.Free.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: action_class$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: action_class$\n\nThis kind of signature is sometimes called a *type class*, a type\n``act:Type``, together with some operations it supports. In this case,\nthe operations tell us what kind of input and output a given action\nexpects.\n\n.. note::\n\n   F* also provides support for type classes and inference of type\n   class instantiations.

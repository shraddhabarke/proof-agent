Given the constraints and the correction, it seems there was a misunderstanding in the initial response. The text provided is a code snippet with functions and concepts related to programming, particularly in a functional programming context or a theorem proving environment like Coq or Agda. However, based on the instructions and the correction, it appears we should focus on identifying entities of specific types (organization, person, geo, event) which are not directly applicable to the provided code snippet. The entities and relationships extracted previously were based on a misinterpretation of the task, attempting to fit programming concepts into the specified entity types.\n\nGiven the nature of the text (a programming code snippet discussing functions like `assoc`, `mem`, `fold_left`, and `map`), and the specified entity types (organization, person, geo, event), there are no entities directly matching these types within the provided text. The text discusses programming concepts and functions, which do not align with the requested entity types of organization, person, geo, or event.\n\nTherefore, based on the correct understanding of the task and the content of the provided text, no additional entities or relationships can be extracted that fit the specified types.

Identify all entities.

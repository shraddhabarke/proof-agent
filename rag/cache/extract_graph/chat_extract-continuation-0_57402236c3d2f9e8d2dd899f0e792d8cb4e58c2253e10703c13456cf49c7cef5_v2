Elements of the type ``odd a`` are constructed\nusing the constructor ``OCons``, which adds a single element to an\n``even a`` list. The types are mutually inductive since their\ndefinitions reference each other.\n\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Vec.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: even_and_odd\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: even_and_odd\n\nAlthough closely related, the types ``even a`` and ``odd a`` are from\ndistinct inductive types. So, to compute, say, the length of one of\nthese lists one generally write a pair of mutually recursive\nfunctions, like so:\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Vec.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: elength_and_olength\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: elength_and_olength\n\nNote, we can prove that the length of an ``even a`` and ``odd a`` are\nreally even and odd.\n\nNow, say, you wanted to map a function over an ``even a``, you'd have\nto write a pair of mutually recursive functions to map simultaneoulsy\nover them both. This can get tedious quickly. Instead of rolling out\nseveral mutually inductive but distinct types, one can instead use an\n*indexed* type to group related types in the same inductive family of\ntypes.\n\nThe definition of ``even_or_odd_list`` below shows an inductive type\nwith one parameter ``a``, for the type of lists elements, and a single\nboolean index, which indicates whether the list is even or odd. Note\nhow the index varies in the types of the constructors, whereas the\nparameter stays the same in all instances.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Vec.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: even_or_odd_list\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: even_or_odd_list\n\nNow, we have a single family of types for both even and odd lists, and\nwe can write a single function that abstracts over both even and odd\nlists, just by abstracting over the boolean index. For example,\n``eo_length`` computes the length of an ``even_or_odd_list``, with its\ntype showing that it returns an even number with ``b`` is true and an\nodd number otherwise.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Vec.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: eo_length\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: eo_length\n\n.. note::\n\n   Note, in ``eo_length`` we had to explicitly specify a decreases\n   clause to prove the function terminating. Why? Refer back to the\n   section on :ref:`default\n   measures<Part1_termination_default_measures>` to recall that by\n   default is the lexicographic ordering of all the arguments in\n   order. So, without the decreases clause, F* will try to prove that\n   the index argument ``b`` decreases on the recursive call, which it\n   does not.\n\nThis is our first type with with both parameters and indices. But why\nstop at just indexing to distinguish even and odd-lengthed lists? We\ncan index a list by its length itself.\n\nVectors\n.......\n\nLet's look again at the definition of the ``vec`` type, first shown in\n:ref:`the introduction<Intro_Vec>`.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Vec.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: vec\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: vec\n\nHere, we're defining just a single type constructor called ``vec``\n(i.e, just :math:`T_1`), which a single parameter ``(a:Type)`` and one\nindex ``nat``.\n\n``vec`` has two data constructors: ``Nil`` builds an instance of ``vec\na 0``, the empty vector; and ``Cons hd tl`` builds an instance of\n``vec a (n + 1)`` from a head element ``hd:a`` and a tail ``tl : vec a\nn``. That is, the two constructors build different instances of\n``vec``---those instances have the same parameter (``a``), but\ndifferent indexes (``0`` and ``n + 1``).\n\n.. note::\n\n   Datatypes in many languages in the ML family, including OCaml and\n   F#, have parameters but no indexes. So, all the data construtors\n   construct the same instance of the type constructor. Further, all\n   data\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>EVEN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A type constructor for lists with an even number of elements, defined in mutually inductive relation with 'odd')\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ODD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A type constructor for lists with an odd number of elements, defined in mutually inductive relation with 'even')\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EVEN_OR_ODD_LIST<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An inductive type grouping even and odd lists with a boolean index indicating the list's parity)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VEC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A single type constructor 'vec' for lists indexed by their length, allowing construction of lists where the length is explicitly tracked in the type)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EVEN<|>ODD<|>Even and odd are mutually inductive, meaning their definitions reference each other to define lists of even or odd lengths<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EVEN_OR_ODD_LIST<|>EVEN<|>Even_or_odd_list abstracts over both even and odd lists, allowing operations across both types through a boolean index<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EVEN_OR_ODD_LIST<|>ODD<|>Even_or_odd_list abstracts over both even and odd lists, allowing operations across both types through a boolean index<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VEC<|>EVEN<|>Vec type can represent lists of any length, including those with even lengths as specified by the even type<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VEC<|>ODD<|>Vec type can represent lists of any length, including those with odd lengths as specified by the odd type<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

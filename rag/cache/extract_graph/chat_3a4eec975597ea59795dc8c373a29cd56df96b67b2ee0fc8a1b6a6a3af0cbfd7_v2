Then, the query stats reported\nfor the real test subject starts in this fresh session.\n\nEven a single poorly chosen quantified assumption in the prover’s\ncontext can make an otherwise simple proof take very long. To\nillustrate, consider the following variation on our example above:\n\nassume Factorial_unbounded: forall (x:nat). exists (y:nat). factorial y > x\n\n#push-options \"--fuel 4 --ifuel 0 --query_stats\"\n#restart-solver\nlet _test_query_stats = assert (factorial 3 == 6)\n\n\nWe’ve now introduced the assumption Factorial_unbounded into our\ncontext. Recall from the SMT encoding of quantified formulas, from the\nSMT solver’s perspective, this looks like the following:\n\n(assert (! (forall ((@x0 Term))\n                   (! (implies (HasType @x0 Prims.nat)\n                               (exists ((@x1 Term))\n                                       (! (and (HasType @x1 Prims.nat)\n                                          (> (BoxInt_proj_0 (SMTEncoding.factorial @x1))\n                                             (BoxInt_proj_0 @x0)))\n                                        :qid assumption_SMTEncoding.Factorial_unbounded.1)))\n                :qid assumption_SMTEncoding.Factorial_unbounded))\n         :named assumption_SMTEncoding.Factorial_unbounded))\n\n\nThis quantifier has no explicit patterns, but Z3 picks the term (HasType @x0 Prims.nat) as the pattern for the forall quantifier. This means that it can instantiate the quantifier for\nactive terms of type nat . But, a single instantiation of the\nquantifier, yields the existentially quantified formula. Existentials\nare immediately skolemized by Z3, i.e., the\nexistentially bound variable is replaced by a fresh function symbol\nthat depends on all the variables in scope. So, a fresh term a @x0 corresponding @x1 is introduced, and immediately, the conjunct HasType (a @x0) Prims.nat becomes an active term and can be used to\ninstantiate the outer universal quantifier again. This “matching loop”\nsends the solver into a long, fruitless search and the simple proof\nabout factorial 3 == 6 which previously succeeded in a few\nmilliseconds, now fails. Here’s are the query stats:\n\n(<input>(18,0-18,49))        Query-stats (SMTEncoding._test_query_stats, 1)  failed\n  {reason-unknown=unknown because canceled} in 5647 milliseconds\n  with fuel 4 and ifuel 0 and rlimit 2723280\n  statistics={ ... quant-instantiations=57046 ... }\n\n\nA few things to notice:\n\n- The failure reason is “unknown because canceled”. That means the\nsolver reached its resource limit and halted the proof\nsearch. Usually, when you see “canceled” as the reason, you could\ntry raising the rlimit, as we’ll see shortly.\n\n- The failure took 5.6 seconds.\n\n- There were 57k quantifier instantiations, as compared to just the\n100 or so we had earlier. We’ll soon seen how to pinpoint which\nquantifiers were instantiated too much.\n\nWe can first retry the proof by giving Z3 more resources—the\ndirective below doubles the resource limit given to Z3.\n\n#push-options \"--z3rlimit_factor 2\"\n\n\nThis time it took 14 seconds and failed. But if you try the same proof\na second time, it succeeds. That’s not very satisfying.\n\nAlthough this is an artificial example, unstable proofs that work and\nthen suddenly fail do happen. Z3 does guarantee that it is\ndeterministic in a very strict sense, but even the smallest change to\nthe input, e.g., a change in variable names, or even asking the same\nquery twice in a succession in the same Z3 session, can result in\ndifferent answers.\n\nThere is often a deeper root cause (in our case, it’s the Factorial_unbounded assumption, of course), but a first attempt at\ndetermining whether or not a proof is “flaky” is to use the F* option --quake .\n\n#push-options \"--quake 5/k\"\nlet _test_query_stats = assert (factorial 3 == 6)\n\n\nThis tries the query 5 times and reports the number of successes and\nfailures.\n\nIn this case, F* reports the following:\n\nQuake: query (SMTEncoding._test_query_stats, 1) succeeded 4/5 times (best fuel=4, best ifuel=0)\n\n\nIf you’re working to stabilize a proof, a good criterion is to see if\nyou can get the proof to go through with the --quake option.\n\nYou can also try the proof by varying the Z3’s random seed and\nchecking that it works with several choices of the seed.\n\n#push-options \"--z3smtopt '(set-option :smt.random_seed 1)'\"\n\n\nWe have a query that’s taking much longer than we’d like and from the\nquery-stats we see that there are a lot of quantifier instances. Now,\nlet’s see how to pin down which quantifier is to blame.\n\n- Get F* to log an .smt2 file, by adding the --log_queries option. It’s important to also add a #restart-solver before\njust before the definition that you’re interested in\nprofiling. #push-options \"--fuel 4 --ifuel 0 --query_stats --log_queries --z3rlimit_factor 2\"\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_3a4eec975597ea59795dc8c373a29cd56df96b67b2ee0fc8a1b6a6a3af0cbfd7_v2"}

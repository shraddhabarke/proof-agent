Atomic operations can make use of invariants, assuming\nthey are true in the current state, and enforced to be true again\nonce the atomic step concludes.\n\nBased on this, and in conjunction with all the other separation logic\nconstructs that we’ve learned about so far, notably the use of ghost\nstate, Pulse enables proofs of concurrent programs.\n\nWe’ve learned so far about two kinds of Pulse computations :\n\n- General purpose, partially correct computations, with the stt computation type\n\n- Ghost computations, proven totally correct, and enforced to be\ncomputationally irrelevant with the stt_ghost computation\ntype.\n\nPulse offers a third kind of computation, atomic computations, with\nthe stt_atomic computation type. Here is the signature of read_atomic and write_atomic from Pulse.Lib.Reference :\n\natomic\nfn read_atomic (r:ref U32.t) (#n:erased U32.t) (#p:perm)\nrequires pts_to r #p n\nreturns x:U32.t\nensures pts_to r #p n ** pure (reveal n == x)\n\n\natomic\nfn write_atomic (r:ref U32.t) (x:U32.t) (#n:erased U32.t)\nrequires pts_to r n\nensures pts_to r x\n\n\nThe atomic annotation on these functions claims that reading and\nwriting 32-bit integers can be done in a single atomic step of\ncomputation.\n\nThis is an assumption about the target architecture on which a Pulse\nprogram is executed. It may be that on some machines, 32-bit values\ncannot be read or written atomically. So, when using atomic\noperations, you should be careful to check that its safe to assume\nthat these operations truly are atomic.\n\nPulse also provides a way for you to declare that other operations are\natomic, e.g., maybe your machine supports 64-bit or 128-bit atomic\noperations—you can program the semantics of these operations in F*\nand add them to Pulse, marking them as atomic.\n\nSometimes, particularly at higher order, you will see atomic\ncomputations described by the computation type below:\n\nval stt_atomic (t:Type) (i:inames) (pre:vprop) (post:t -> vprop)\n  : Type u#4\n\n\nLike stt_ghost , atomic computations are total and live in universe u#4 . As such, you cannot store an atomic function in the state,\ni.e., ref (unit -> stt_atomic t i p q) is not a well-formed type.\n\nAtomic computations and ghost computations are also indexed by i:inames , where inames is a set of invariant names. We’ll\nlearn about these next.\n\nIn Pulse.Lib.Core , we have the following types:\n\n[@@erasable]\nval iref : Type0\nval inv (i:iref) (p:vprop) : vprop\n\n\nThink of inv i p as a predicate asserting that p is true in\nthe current state and all future states of the program. Every\ninvariant has a name, i:iref , though, the name is only relevant in\nspecifications, i.e., it is erasable.\n\nA closely related type is iname :\n\nval iname : eqtype\nlet inames = erased (FStar.Set.set iname)\n\n\nEvery iref can be turned into an iname , with the function iname_of (i:iref): GTot iname .\n\nInvariants are duplicable, i.e., from inv i p one can prove inv i p ** inv i p , as shown by type of Pulse.Lib.Core.dup_inv below:\n\nval dup_inv (i:iref) (p:vprop)\n  : stt_ghost unit emp_inames (inv i p) (fun _ -> inv i p ** inv i p)\n\n\nPulse’s language of predicates, i.e., the type vprop , is\nstratified. The type boxable is a refinement of vprop , defined\nas shown below in Pulse.Lib.Core\n\nlet boxable = v:vprop { is_big v }\n\n\nThat is, certain vprops , i.e., those that satisfy is_big , are boxable predicates. All the predicates that we have encountered so\nfar are boxable, except for the inv i p predicate. For example, pts_to x v is boxable; exists* x. p x is boxable if p x is\nboxable; etc. However inv i p is not boxable.\n\nWhy does this matter? It turns out that PulseCore, the logic on which\nPulse is built, only allows turning boxable predicates into\ninvariants. That is, while one can build an invariant such as inv i (exists* v. pts_to x v) , one cannot nest invariants, i.e., there\nis no meaningful way to construct an instance of inv i (inv j p) .\n\nThis restriction is a fundamental limitation of PulseCore: invariants\ncannot mention other invariants. In more technical terms, invariants\nare predicative\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ATOMIC OPERATIONS<|>EVENT<|>Operations guaranteed to be executed in a single-step of computation without interruption by other threads)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INVARIANTS<|>EVENT<|>Named predicates that are enforced to be true at all times, used alongside atomic operations)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PULSE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A framework or system that enables proofs of concurrent programs through constructs like atomic operations and invariants)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPIN LOCKS<|>EVENT<|>A concurrency control mechanism used in computing)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PARALLEL INCREMENT<|>EVENT<|>A method or process in computing for increasing values in parallel computation scenarios)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EXTRACTION<|>EVENT<|>A process or method in computing, possibly related to data or information extraction)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PULSE.LIB.REFERENCE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Part of the Pulse framework that includes the signature of read_atomic and write_atomic functions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STT_ATOMIC<|>EVENT<|>A type of computation in Pulse for atomic computations)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STT_GHOST<|>EVENT<|>A type of computation in Pulse for ghost computations, which are proven totally correct and computationally irrelevant)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PULSE.LIB.CORE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Core part of the Pulse framework dealing with the language of predicates and invariants)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ATOMIC OPERATIONS<|>INVARIANTS<|>Atomic operations can make use of invariants, assuming they are true in the current state<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PULSE<|>ATOMIC OPERATIONS<|>Pulse framework is built around concepts including atomic operations<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PULSE<|>INVARIANTS<|>Pulse framework uses invariants as part of its concurrency control mechanisms<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PULSE.LIB.REFERENCE<|>STT_ATOMIC<|>Pulse.Lib.Reference includes the signature for atomic computations like read_atomic and write_atomic<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PULSE.LIB.CORE<|>INVARIANTS<|>Pulse.Lib.Core deals with the language of predicates including invariants<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

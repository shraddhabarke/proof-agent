Then, from step 9, we have fibonacci (n-3) >= 2 10.2  If n=3 , then fibonacci 0 = 1 , so we have a contradiction. 10.3  If n > 3 , then 10.3.1. fibonacci (n-2) = fibonacci (n-3) + fibonacci (n-4) , by definition 10.3.2. fibonacci (n-3) + fibonacci (n-4) >= fibonacci (n-3) , since fibonacci (n-4) : nat . 10.3.3. fibonacci (n-2) >= fibonacci (n-3) , using 10.3.1 and 10.3.2 10.3.4. fibonacci (n-2) >= 2 , using 10.1 10.3.5. But, 10.3.4 contradicts 10; so the proof is complete.\n\nYou probably wouldn’t have come up with this proof yourself, and\nindeed, it took us some puzzling to figure out how the SMT solver\nwas able to prove this lemma with just one use of the induction\nhypothesis. But, there you have it. All of which is to say that\nthe SMT solver is quite powerful!\n\nEarlier , we saw a definition of append with the following type:\n\nval append (#a:Type) (l1 l2:list a)\n  : l:list a{length l = length l1 + length l2}\n\n\nNow, suppose we were to define app` , a version of append with a\nweaker type, as shown below.\n\nlet rec app #a (l1 l2:list a)\n  : list a\n  = match l1 with\n    | [] -> l2\n    | hd :: tl -> hd :: app tl l2\n\n\nCan you prove the following lemma?\n\nval app_length (#a:Type) (l1 l2:list a)\n  : Lemma (length (app l1 l2) = length l1 + length l2)\n\n\nAnswer\n\nlet rec app_length #a l1 l2\n  = match l1 with\n    | [] -> ()\n    | _ :: tl -> app_length tl l2\n\n\nAs the previous exercise illustrates, you can prove properties either\nby enriching the type of a function or by writing a separate lemma\nabout it—we call these the ‘intrinsic’ and ‘extrinsic’ styles,\nrespectively. Which style to prefer is a matter of taste and\nconvenience: generally useful properties are often good candidates for\nintrinsic specification (e.g, that length returns a nat ); more\nspecific properties are better stated and proven as lemmas. However,\nin some cases, as in the following example, it may be impossible to\nprove a property of a function directly in its type—you must resort\nto a lemma.\n\nlet rec reverse #a (l:list a)\n  : list a\n  = match l with\n    | [] -> []\n    | hd :: tl -> append (reverse tl) [hd]\n\n\nLet’s try proving that reversing a list twice is the identity\nfunction.  It’s possible to specify this property in the type of reverse using a refinement type.\n\nval reverse (#a:Type) : f:(list a -> list a){forall l. l == f (f l)}\n\n\nNote\n\nA subtle point: the refinement on reverse above uses a propositional equality . That’s because equality on\nlists of arbitrary types is not decidable, e.g., consider list (int -> int) .  All the proofs below will rely on propositional\nequality.\n\nHowever, F* refuses to accept this as a valid type for reverse :\nproving this property requires two separate inductions, neither of\nwhich F* can perform automatically.\n\nInstead, one can use two lemmas to prove the property we care\nabout. Here it is:\n\n(* snoc is \"cons\" backwards --- it adds an element to the end of a list *)\nlet snoc l h = append l [h]\n\nlet rec snoc_cons #a (l:list a) (h:a)\n  : Lemma (reverse (snoc l h) == h :: reverse l)\n  = match l with\n    | [] -> ()\n    | hd :: tl -> snoc_cons tl h\n\nlet rec rev_involutive #a (l:list a)\n  : Lemma (reverse (reverse l) == l)\n  = match l with\n    | [] -> ()\n    | hd :: tl ->\n      // (1) [reverse (reverse tl) == tl]\n      rev_involutive tl;\n      // (2) [reverse (append (reverse tl) [hd]) == h :: reverse (reverse tl)]\n      snoc_cons (reverse tl) hd\n      // These two facts are enough for Z3 to prove the lemma:\n      //   reverse (reverse (hd :: tl))\n      //   =def= reverse (append (reverse tl) [hd])\n      //   =(2)= hd :: reverse (reverse tl)\n      //   =(1)= hd :: tl\n      //   =def= l\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_57dc7880c2bba87da21825066c8fab176359940044d28c2a132e58dfe2fe8ea2_v2"}

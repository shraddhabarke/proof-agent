The type and its operations are handled primitively in\n/// F*'s SMT encoding, which maps them to the SMT sort of bit vectors\n/// and operations on that sort. Note that this encoding only applies\n/// when the length [n] is a syntactic literal: bit vectors with a\n/// length referring to some variable, bound or otherwise, are encoded\n/// as abstract sequences of bits.\n///\n/// Because of this syntactic encoding, it is also often helpful to\n/// explicitly specify the bit length on all operations -- for example\n/// constructing a 64-bit vector with [int2bv #64 1]. These explicit\n/// annotations ensure that the encoding uses the literal length 64,\n/// rather than inferring some variable as the length.\n///\n/// One way to use this module is in conjunction with\n/// FStar.Tactics.BV. Its main tactic, [bv_tac], converts bitwise\n/// operations on unsigned integers to operations on bit vectors and\n/// back using the [int2bv / bv2int] isomorphism. This can be an\n/// effective way of discharging such proof obligations for bitwise\n/// operations on integers using the SMT solver's theory of\n/// bitvectors.\n\nopen FStar.UInt\n// for now just opening this for logand, logxor, etc. but we need a better solution.\n\n(** The main type of this module, bit vectors of length [n], with\n    decidable equality *)\nval bv_t (n: nat) : eqtype\n\n(* Experimental:\n   Redefining basic type from UInt to avoid importing UInt\n   Reduces verification time by 50% in small examples\n// let max_int (n:nat) : Tot int = pow2 n - 1\n// let min_int (n:nat) : Tot int = 0\n// let fits (x:int) (n:nat) : Tot bool = min_int n <= x && x <= max_int n\n// let size (x:int) (n:nat) : Tot Type0 = b2t(fits x n)\n// type uint_t' (n:nat) = x:int{size x n}\n*)\n\n(** Extending a bit vector of length [n] to a larger vector of size\n    [m+n], filling the extra bits with 0 *)\nval bv_uext (#n #m: pos) (a: bv_t n) : Tot (normalize (bv_t (m + n)))\n\n(**** Relating unsigned integers to bitvectors *)\n\n(** Mapping a bounded unsigned integer of size [< 2^n], to a n-length\n    bit vector *)\nval int2bv (#n: pos) (num: uint_t n) : Tot (bv_t n)\n\n(** Mapping a bit vector back to a bounded unsigned integer of size [<\n    2^n] *)\nval bv2int (#n: pos) (vec: bv_t n) : Tot (uint_t n)\n\nval int2bv_lemma_1 (#n: pos) (a b: uint_t n)\n    : Lemma (requires a = b) (ensures (int2bv #n a = int2bv #n b))\n\nval int2bv_lemma_2 (#n: pos) (a b: uint_t n)\n    : Lemma (requires (int2bv a = int2bv b)) (ensures a = b)\n\nval inverse_vec_lemma (#n: pos) (vec: bv_t n)\n    : Lemma (requires True) (ensures vec = (int2bv (bv2int vec))) [SMTPat (int2bv (bv2int vec))]\n\nval inverse_num_lemma (#n: pos) (num: uint_t n)\n    : Lemma (requires True)\n      (ensures num = bv2int #n (int2bv #n num))\n      [SMTPat (bv2int #n (int2bv #n num))]\n\n(**** Relating lists to bitvectors *)\n\n(** Mapping a list of booleans to a bitvector *)\nval list2bv (#n: pos) (l: list bool {List.length l = n}) : Tot (bv_t n)\n\n(** Mapping a bitvector to a list of booleans *)\nval bv2list: #n: pos -> bv_t n -> Tot (l: list bool {List.length l = n})\n\nval list2bv_bij (#n: pos) (a: list bool {List.length a = n})\n    : Lemma (requires (True)) (ensures (bv2list (list2bv #n a) = a))\n\nval bv2list_bij (#n: pos) (a: bv_t n)\n    : Lemma (requires (True)) (ensures (list2bv (bv2list #n a) = a))\n\n(**** Bitwise logical operators *)\n\n(** Bitwise conjunction *)\nval bvand (#n: pos) (a b: bv_t n) : Tot (bv_t n)\n\nval int2bv_logand:\n    #n: pos ->\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>FSTAR.BV<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A module in F* programming language that defines an abstract type of length-indexed bit vectors, with operations that are handled primitively in F*'s SMT encoding>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FSTAR.TACTICS.BV<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A module in F* that provides tactics for converting bitwise operations on unsigned integers to operations on bit vectors and back>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FSTAR.UINT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A module in F* that is opened within FStar.BV for operations like logand, logxor, but the document suggests a need for a better solution for integration>)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FSTAR.BV<|>FSTAR.TACTICS.BV<|>FStar.BV module is used in conjunction with FStar.Tactics.BV for effective discharging of proof obligations for bitwise operations<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FSTAR.BV<|>FSTAR.UINT<|>FStar.BV opens FStar.UInt for certain operations, indicating a dependency or usage relationship<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

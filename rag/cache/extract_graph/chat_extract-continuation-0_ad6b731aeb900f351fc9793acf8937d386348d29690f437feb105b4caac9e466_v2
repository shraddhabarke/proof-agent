So, from lock_inv we have p , and we can\n“take it out” of the lock and return it out of block as maybe true p . And, importantly, we can trivially restore the lock_inv ,\nsince we know its currently value is 1ul , i.e., maybe (1ul = 0ul) _ == emp .\n\n- If the cas_box fails, we just restore lock_inv and return\nfalse.\n\nOutside the with_invariants block, if the CAS succeeded, then\nwe’re done: we have p to return to the caller. Otherwise, we\nrecurse and try again.\n\nRewrite the tail-recursive acquire using a while loop.\n\nReleasing a lock is somewhat easier, at least for a simple version.\nThe signature is the dual of acquire : the caller has to give up p to the lock.\n\nfn release (#p:vprop) (l:lock)\nrequires lock_alive l p ** p\nensures lock_alive l p\n{\n  unfold lock_alive;\n  with_invariants l.i\n    returns _:unit\n    ensures inv l.i (lock_inv l.r p)\n    opens (add_inv emp_inames l.i) {\n    unfold lock_inv;\n    write_atomic_box l.r 0ul;\n    drop_ (maybe _ _); //double release\n    fold (maybe (0ul = 0ul) p);\n    fold (lock_inv l.r p);\n  };\n  fold lock_alive\n}\n\n\nIn this implementation, release unconditionally sets the reference\nto 0ul and reproves the lock_inv , since we have p in\ncontext.\n\nHowever, if the lock was already in the released state, it may already\nhold p —releasing an already released lock can allow the caller\nto leak resources.\n\nRewrite release to spin until the lock is acquired, before\nreleasing it. This is not a particularly realistic design for avoiding\na double release, but it’s a useful exercise.\n\nRedesign the lock API to prevent double releases. One way to do this\nis when acquiring to lock to give out a permission to release it, and\nfor release to require and consume that permission.\n\nAdd a liveness predicate, with fractional permissions, to allow a lock\nto be allocated, then shared among several threads, then gathered, and\neventually free’d.\n\n© Copyright 2020, Microsoft Research.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>LOCK_ALIVE<|>EVENT<|>A state or condition indicating that a lock is active and operational within a concurrent programming context\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CAS_BOX<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A function or method used to perform an atomic compare-and-swap operation on a memory location\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LOCK_INV<|>EVENT<|>An invariant associated with a lock, ensuring the lock's state remains consistent and valid throughout its operations\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WITH_INVARIANTS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A programming construct or block that ensures certain invariants are maintained before and after its execution\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CAS_BOX<|>LOCK_INV<|>CAS_BOX operation is used within the context of maintaining the LOCK_INV invariant<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LOCK_ALIVE<|>LOCK_INV<|>LOCK_INV is a crucial part of ensuring a lock is in the LOCK_ALIVE state<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WITH_INVARIANTS<|>LOCK_INV<|>WITH_INVARIANTS block is used to maintain LOCK_INV during lock operations<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

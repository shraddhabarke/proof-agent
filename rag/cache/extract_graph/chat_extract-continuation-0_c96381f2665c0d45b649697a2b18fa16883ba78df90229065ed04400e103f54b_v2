In EApp , e is definitely not a variable, so bool_order (EVar? e) is 1 . if e1 (respectively e2 ) are\nvariables, then this recursive call terminates, the lexicographic\ntuple (0, _, _, _) << (1, _, _, _) , regardles of the other\nvalues. Otherwise, the last component of the tuple decreases\n(since e1 and e2 are proper sub-terms of e ), while\nnone of the other components of the tuple change. The call to sub_elam s in ELam terminates because the\nthird component of the tuple decreases from 1 to 0 , while\nthe first two do not change. The final recursive call to subst terminates for similar\nreasons to the recursive calls in the EApp case, since the\ntype of sub_elam guarantees that sub_elam s is renaming if\nan only of s is (so the r bit does not change).\n\n- The EUnit and EVar cases are trivial, as before.\n\n- In EApp , e is definitely not a variable, so bool_order (EVar? e) is 1 . if e1 (respectively e2 ) are\nvariables, then this recursive call terminates, the lexicographic\ntuple (0, _, _, _) << (1, _, _, _) , regardles of the other\nvalues.

So, we have two cases to consider: If s (y - 1) is a variable, then bool_order (EVar? e) , the\nfirst component of the decreases clause of subst is 0 ,\nwhich clearly precedes 1 , the first component of the decreases\nclause of subst_elam . Otherwwise, s (y - 1) is not a variable, so s is\ndefinitely not a renaming while sub_inc is. So, the second\nsecond component of the decreases clause decreases while the first\ncomponent is unchanged.\n\n- If s (y - 1) is a variable, then bool_order (EVar? e) , the\nfirst component of the decreases clause of subst is 0 ,\nwhich clearly precedes 1 , the first component of the decreases\nclause of subst_elam .\n\n- Otherwwise, s (y - 1) is not a variable, so s is\ndefinitely not a renaming while sub_inc is. So, the second\nsecond component of the decreases clause decreases while the first\ncomponent is unchanged.\n\nFinally, we need to prove that sub_elam s is a renaming if and\nonly if s is. For this, we need two things:\n\n- First, strengthen the type of subst s to show that it maps\nvariables to variables if and only if r is a renaming,\n\n- Second, we need to instantiate an exisential quantifier in sub_elam , to show that if s is not a renaming, then it must\nmap some x to a non-variable and, hence, sub_elam s (x + 1) is a non-variable too. One way to do this is by asserting this fact,\nwhich is a sufficient hint to the SMT solver to find the\ninstantiation needed. Another way is to explicitly introduce the\nexistential, as in the exercise below.\n\nIn summary, using indexed types combined with well-founded recursion\non lexicographic orderings, we were able to prove our definitions\ntotal. That said, coming up with such orderings is non-trivial and\nrequires some ingenuity, but once you do, it allows for relatively\ncompact definitions that handle both substiutions and renamings.\n\nRemove the first component of the decreases clause of both definitions\nand revise the definitions to make F* accept it.\n\nYour solution should have signature\n\nlet rec subst1 (#r:bool)\n               (s:sub r)\n               (e:exp)\n  : Tot (e':exp { r ==> (EVar? e <==> EVar? e') })\n        (decreases %[bool_order r;\n                     1;\n                     e])\n...\n\nand sub_elam1 (#r:bool) (s:sub r)\n  : Tot (sub r)\n        (decreases %[bool_order r;\n                     0;\n                     EVar 0])\n\n\nHint\n\nInline a case of subst in subst_elam .\nThe answer is included with the next problem below.\n\nReplace the assertion in subst_elam with a proof that explicitly\nintroduces the existential quantifier.\n\nAnswer\n\nlet rec subst1 (#r:bool\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

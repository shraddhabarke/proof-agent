This is useful here, since we don’t really\nwant to overload the name properties as an operator over all\ninstances bound the class. It’s often convenient to simply open FStar.Tactics.Typeclasses when using typeclasses, or to use a\nmodule abbreviation like module TC = FStar.Tactics.Typeclasses so that you don’t have to use a fully qualified name for no_method .\n\nFor all bounded_unsigned_ints , one can define a generic fits predicate, corresponding to the bounds check condition that we\nintroduced in the UInt32 interface.\n\nlet fits #a {| bounded_unsigned_int a |}\n            (op: int -> int -> int)\n            (x y:a)\n  : prop\n  = 0 <= op (as_nat x) (as_nat y) /\\\n    op (as_nat x) (as_nat y) <= as_nat #a bound\n\n\nLikewise, the predicate related_ops defines when an operation bop on bounded integers is equivalent to an operation iop on\nmathematical integers.\n\nlet related_ops #a {| bounded_unsigned_int a |}\n                (iop: int -> int -> int)\n                (bop: (x:a -> y:a { fits iop x y } -> a))\n  = forall (x y:a).  fits iop x y ==> as_nat (bop x y) = as_nat x `iop` as_nat y\n\n\nOur bounded_unsigned_int a class just showed that a is in a\nbijection with natural numbers below some bound. Now, we can define a\nseparate class, extending bounded_unsigned_int with the operations\nwe want, like addition, subtraction, etc.\n\nclass bounded_unsigned_int_ops (a:Type) = {\n   [@@@TC.no_method]\n   base       : bounded_unsigned_int a;\n   add        : (x:a -> y:a { fits ( + ) x y } -> a);\n   sub        : (x:a -> y:a { fits op_Subtraction x y } -> a);\n   lt         : (a -> a -> bool);\n   [@@@TC.no_method]\n   properties : squash (\n     related_ops ( + ) add /\\\n     related_ops op_Subtraction sub /\\      \n     (forall (x y:a). lt x y <==> as_nat x < as_nat y) /\\ // lt is related to <\n     (forall (x:a). fits op_Subtraction bound x) //subtracting from the maximum element never triggers underflow\n   )\n}\n\n\nThe class above makes use of typeclass inheritance . The base field stores an instance of the base class bounded_unsigned_int ,\nwhile the remaining fields extend it with:\n\n- add : a bounded addition operation\n\n- sub : a bounded subtraction operation\n\n- lt : a comparison function\n\n- properties , which show that add is related to integer addition + sub is related to integer subtraction - lt is related to < and that sub bound x is always safe\n\n- add is related to integer addition +\n\n- sub is related to integer subtraction -\n\n- lt is related to <\n\n- and that sub bound x is always safe\n\nTypeclass inheritance in the form of additional fields like base is completely flexible, e.g., multiple inheritance is permissible\n(though, as we’ll see below, should be used with care, to prevent\nsurprises).\n\nTreating an instance of a class as an instance of one its base classes\nis easily coded as instance-generating function. The code below says\nthat an instance from bounded_unsigned_int a can be derived from\nan instance of d : bounded_unsigned_int_ops a just by projecting\nits base field.\n\ninstance ops_base #a {| d : bounded_unsigned_int_ops a |} \n  : bounded_unsigned_int a\n  = d.base\n\n\nF* does not allows the fields of a record to be named using infix\noperator symbols. This will likely change in the future. For now,\nto use custom operations with infix notation for typeclass methods,\none has to define them by hand:\n\nlet ( +^ ) #a {| bounded_unsigned_int_ops a |}\n           (x : a)\n           (y : a { fits ( + ) x y })\n  : a\n  = add x y\n\nlet ( -^ ) #a {| bounded_unsigned_int_ops a |}\n           (x : a)\n           (y : a { fits op_Subtraction x y })\n  : a\n  = sub x y\n\nlet ( <^ ) #a {| bounded_unsigned_int_ops a |}\n           (x : a)\n           (y : a)\n  : bool\n  = lt x y\n\n\nWe’ve already seen how typeclass inheritance allows a class to induce\nan instance of its base class(es). However, not all derived instances\nare due to explicit inheritance—some instances can be computed from others.\n\nFor example, here’s a class eq for types that support decidable\nequality.\n\nclass eq (a:Type) = {\n  eq_op: a -> a -> bool;\n\n  [@@@TC.no_method]\n  properties : squash (\n    forall x y. eq_op x y <==> x == y\n  )\n}\n\nlet ( =?= ) #a {| eq a\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>FSTAR.TACTICS.TYPECLASSES.NO_METHOD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Attribute used in F* to prevent generating a typeclass method for a field, useful for avoiding name overloading in typeclasses)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BOUNDED_UNSIGNED_INT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A class in F* representing types that are in bijection with natural numbers below a certain bound, allowing for operations within those bounds)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BOUNDED_UNSIGNED_INT_OPS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An extension of the bounded_unsigned_int class in F* that includes operations like addition, subtraction, and comparison)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EQ<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A class in F* for types supporting decidable equality, with a property that equates the eq_op operation to the equality of two elements)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BOUNDED_UNSIGNED_INT_OPS<|>BOUNDED_UNSIGNED_INT<|>The bounded_unsigned_int_ops class extends the bounded_unsigned_int class with additional operations and properties<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FSTAR.TACTICS.TYPECLASSES.NO_METHOD<|>BOUNDED_UNSIGNED_INT_OPS<|>Used within bounded_unsigned_int_ops to avoid overloading the name properties as an operator over all instances<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FSTAR.TACTICS.TYPECLASSES.NO_METHOD<|>EQ<|>Used within eq to avoid overloading the name properties as an operator over all instances<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

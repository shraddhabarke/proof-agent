That is, Tup2 is a constructor of tup2 , such that given x:a and y:b , Tup2 x y : tup2 a b .\n\nThe other types tup3 and tup4 are similar—the type\nannotations on the bound variables can be inferred.\n\nThese are inductive types with just one case—so the discriminators Tup2? , Tup3? , and Tup4? aren’t particularly useful. But,\nwe need a way to extract, or project , the components of a tuple. You\ncan do that with a match .\n\nlet tup2_fst #a #b (x:tup2 a b)\n  : a\n  = match x with\n    | Tup2 fst _ -> fst\n\nlet tup2_snd #a #b (x:tup2 a b)\n  : b\n  = match x with\n    | Tup2 _ snd -> snd\n\nlet tup3_fst #a #b #c (x:tup3 a b c)\n  : a\n  = match x with\n    | Tup3 fst _ _ -> fst\n\nlet tup3_snd #a #b #c (x:tup3 a b c)\n  : b\n  = match x with\n    | Tup3 _ snd _ -> snd\n\nlet tup3_third #a #b #c (x:tup3 a b c)\n  : c\n  = match x with\n    | Tup3 _ _ thd -> thd\n\n\nThese projectors are common enough that F* auto-generates them for\nyou. In particular, for any data constructor T of type x1:t1 -> ... -> xn:tn -> t , F* auto-generates the following function:\n\n- T?.xi : y:t{T? y} -> ti\n\nThat is, T?.xi is a function which when applied to a y:t in\ncase T? y , returns the xi component of T x1 ... xn .\n\nIn the case of our tup2 and tup3 types, we have\n\n- Tup2?.fst , Tup2?.snd\n\n- Tup3?.fst , Tup3?.snd , Tup3?.thd\n\nSince tuples are so common, the module FStar.Pervasives.Native.fst defines tuple types up to arity 14. So, you shouldn’t have to define tup2 and tup3 etc. by yourself.\n\nThe tuple types in FStar.Pervasives.Native come with syntactic\nsugar.\n\n- You can write a & b instead of the tup2 a b ; a & b & c instead of tup3 a b c ; and so on, up to arity 14.\n\n- You can write x, y instead of Tup2 x y ; x, y, z instead\nof Tup3 x y z ; an so on, up to arity 14.\n\n- You can write x._1 , x._2 , x._3 , etc. to project the\nfield i of a tuple whose arity is at least i .\n\nThat said, if you’re using tuples beyond arity 4 or 5, it’s probably a\ngood idea to define a record , as we’ll see next—since it can be hard\nto remember what the components of a large tuple represent.\n\nA record is just a tuple with user-chosen names for its fields and\nwith special syntax for constructing then and projecting their\nfields. Here’s an example.\n\ntype point3D = { x:int; y:int; z:int}\n\nlet origin = { y=0; x=0; z=0 }\n\nlet dot (p0 p1:point3D) = p0.x * p1.x + p0.y * p1.y + p0.z * p1.z\n\nlet translate_X (p:point3D) (shift:int) = { p with x = p.x + shift}\n\nlet is_origin (x:point3D) =\n  match x with\n  | {z=0;y=0;x=0} -> true\n  | _ -> false\n\n\n- A record type is defined using curly braces {} . See type point3D\n\n- A record value is also constructed using curly braces, with an\nassignment for each field of the record. The fields need not be\ngiven in order. See origin .\n\n- To access the fields of a record, you can use the dot notation p.x ; See dot , which computes a dot product using dot\nnotation.\n\n- Records also support the with notation to construct a new record\nwhose fields are the same as the old record, except for those fields\nmentioned after the with . That is, translate_X p shift returns { x = p.x + shift; y = p.y; z = p.z} .\n\n- Records can also be used to pattern match a value. For example, in is_origin , we match the fields of the record (in any order)\nagainst some patterns.\n\nAnother common type from F*’s standard library is the option type,\nwhich is useful to represent a possibly missing value.\n\nConsider implementing a function to divide x / y , for two integers x and y . This function cannot be defined when y is zero,\nbut it can be defined partially, by excluding the case where y = 0 , as shown below. (Of course, one can also refine the domain of the\nfunction to forbid y = 0 , but we’re just trying to illustrate the option type here.)\n\nlet try_divide (x y:int)\n  : option int\n  = if y = 0 then None else Some (x\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_f73be56f582b695d91898630ef89714938474d5f25516eaeeed4344983cd077e_v2"}

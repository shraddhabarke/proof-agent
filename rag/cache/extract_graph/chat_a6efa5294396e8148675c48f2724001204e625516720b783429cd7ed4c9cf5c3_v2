This function cannot be defined when ``y`` is zero,\nbut it can be defined partially, by excluding the case where ``y =\n0``, as shown below. (Of course, one can also refine the domain of the\nfunction to forbid ``y = 0``, but we're just trying to illustrate the\n``option`` type here.)\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Part1.Inductives.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: option\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: option\n\nLike most other functional languages, F* does not have a ``null``\nvalue. Whenever a value may possibly be ``null``, one typically uses\nthe ``option`` type, using ``None`` to signify null and ``Some v`` for\nthe non-null case.\n\nUnions, or the ``either`` type\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\n``FStar.Pervasives`` also defines the ``either`` type, shown below.\n\n.. code-block:: fstar\n\n   type either a b =\n     | Inl : v: a -> either a b\n     | Inr : v: b -> either a b\n\nThe type ``either a b`` represents a value that could either be ``Inl\nv`` with ``v:a``, or ``Inr v`` with ``v:b``. That is, ``either a b``\nis a tagged union of the ``a`` and ``b``. It's easy to write functions\nto analyze the tag ``Inl`` (meaning it's \"in the left case\") or\n``Inr`` (\"in the right case\") and compute with the underlying\nvalues. Here's an example:\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Part1.Inductives.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: either\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: either\n\nThe ``same_case x y`` function decides if the two unions are both\nsimultaneously in the left or right case.\n\nThen, in ``sum x y``, with a refinement that ``x`` and ``y`` are in\nthe same case, we can handle just two cases (when they are both in\nleft, or both in right) and F* can prove that the case analysis is\nexhaustive. In the left case, the underlying values are boolean, so we\ncombine them with ``||``; in the right case, the underlying values are\nintegers, so we combine them with ``+``; and return them with the\nappropriate tag. The type of the result ``z:either bool int{ Inl? z <==>\nInl? x}`` shows that the result has the same case as ``x`` (and hence\nalso ``y``). We could have written the result type as ``z:either bool\nint { same_case z x }``.\n\n.. _Part1_inductives_list:\n\nLists\n^^^^^\n\nAll the types we've seen so far have been inductive only in a degenerate\nsense—the constructors do not refer to the types they construct. Now,\nfor our first truly inductive type, a list.\n\nHere's the definition of ``list`` from ``Prims``:\n\n.. code-block:: fstar\n\n   type list a =\n     | Nil  : list a\n     | Cons : hd:a -> tl:list a -> list a\n\nThe ``list`` type is available implicitly in all F* programs and we\nhave special (but standard) syntax for the list constructors:\n\n* ``[]`` is ``Nil``\n* ``[v1; ...; vn]`` is ``Cons v1 ... (Cons vn Nil)``\n* ``hd :: tl`` is ``Cons hd tl``.\n\nYou can always just write out the constructors like `Nil` and `Cons`\nexplicitly, if you find that useful (e.g., to partially apply ``Cons\nhd : list a -> list a``).\n\n.. _Part1_inductives_length:\n\nLength of a list\n................\n\nLet's write some simple functions on lists, starting with computing\nthe length of a list.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Part1.Inductives.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: length\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: length\n\nThe ``length`` function is recursive and implicitly polymorphic in a\ntype ``a``. For any list ``l : list a``, ``length l`` returns a\n``nat``. The definition pattern matches on the list and calls\n``length`` recursively on the tail of list, until the ``[]`` case is\nreached.\n\n.. _Part1_inductives_append:\n\nExercises\n^^^^^^^^^\n\n`Click here <../code/exercises/Part1.Inductives.fst>`_ for the exercise file.\n\nHere's the definition of ``append``, a function that concatenates two\nlists. Can you give it a type that proves it always returns a list\nwhose length is the sum of the lengths of its arguments?\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Part1.Inductives.fst\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_a6efa5294396e8148675c48f2724001204e625516720b783429cd7ed4c9cf5c3_v2"}

To set a data breakpoint the user stops at a point where the intended variable is in scope. Right-clicking on the variable name brings up the following menu with the option “Break on Value Change”. The data breakpoint is then visible in the BREAKPOINTS pane (see above), where it can be enabled/disabled/deleted. Data breakpoints trigger during either a forward or a backward execution.\n\nThis feature is only available in trace mode, and only for global variables and memories. It is not available for local variables.\n\n\nTroubleshooting\n\nCheck that the extension has been correctly installed by looking in $HOME/.vscode/extensions/microsoft.vscode-pd-extension-<x.y.z>\n\nOn Windows, $HOME is %USERPROFILE% by default.\n\nOn Linux, check that the file DebugAdapter is executable.\n\nInside VsCode, opening any Sandpiper source file with file extension pd should show the syntax highlighted (colored keywords).\n\nOpening a Sandpiper report file (extension pdrpt ) should present a spreadsheet-like view of the data. In the compiler-generated files folder there is a ResourceReport.pdrpt file which can be used for testing.\n\nMake sure the compilation switches include --debug --optimize=0\n\n\nExample\n\nThe Sandpiper nuget contains a samples/helloworld application, usable to test the debugger.\n\nAfter building the application as described in the readme.md file, the user starts VSCode as follows:\n\ncd helloworld<br>\ncode .\n\nInside VsCode the user performs the following steps:\n\n1. Open the source file helloworld.pd and put a breakpoint in the AddOne function, line 7.\n\n1. Select Run and Debug (Ctrl-Shift-D). This shows a dropdown with the three configurations Sandpiper Interpreter , Sandpiper Trace , and Cpp Debug\n2. Click on the green arrow for Sandpiper Interpreter . The application should start running and stop at the breakpoint. Navigate the various panes to familiarize with the Debugger. For instance, expand the Locals pane to see the local variable x with value 3.\n3. Click on the continue button. The application terminates.\n4. Repeat the debugging, using the trace file PbTrace.txt generated when running the interpreter in the previous step. Select Run and Debug (Ctrl-Shift-D) and click on Sandpiper Trace . In addition to the commands available in the “Sandpiper Interpreter” case, now there are debugger commands for reverse execution e.g. for Time-Travel Debugging.\n5. Click on the continue button. The application stops at the last cycle, does not terminate. Only a subsequent continue will. This is because stopAtExit is enabled by default.\n\n\nExercises\n\nAdd a function that AddOne calls. Experiment with stepping in/out, and with the reverse execution buttons.\n\nAdd a pipelined function, single step. Select the various threads.\n\nAdd a global variable and create a data breakpoint for it.\n\nAdd the wave option in the launch.json file to create and visualize a VCD trace.\n\nUse the Cpp Debug configuration to debug the C++ testbench (e.g. in main.cpp). Note that we can only attach to the C++ program, and only once the interpreter is stopped somewhere.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>DATA BREAKPOINT<|>EVENT<|>A data breakpoint suspends execution when the selected variable is modified.

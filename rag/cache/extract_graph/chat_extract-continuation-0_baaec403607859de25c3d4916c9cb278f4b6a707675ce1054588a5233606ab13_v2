Can be used to compute percentages.\n\n\nExample\n\nLet us assume the following filesystem layout for a Sandpiper application:\n\nC:\\MyRepo // root of the enlistment\n\nC:\\MyRepo\\src\\pd // Sandpiper sources here\n\nC:\\MyRepo\\src\\myApp.pd // Sandpiper source file\n\nC:\\MyRepo\\src\\simpleTest // host-side test code\n\nC:\\MyRepo\\src\\simpleTest\\main.cpp\n\nThe first step is to add the run-time data collection object to the host-side code, say into main.cpp. This is done by adding the code lines marked as 1-3 in the following C++ code snippet.\n\n// (1) Add this include after the generated Sandpiper header file has been included\n#include \"PipeDreamProfiler.h\"\n\nint main(...)\n{\n    PipeDream::ProxyDescription proxyDescription;\n\n    ...\n\n    std::shared_ptr<PipeDream::Proxy> proxy = PipeDream::CreateProxy(&proxyDescription);\n\n    ...\n\n    // (2) Create the profiler object, passing the filename for the profile output\n    PipeDream::Profiler profiler(proxy, \"simpleTest.profile.csv\");\n\n    // (3) Start profiling. Could be done later, if desired.\n    profiler.Start();\n\n    ...\n    // Run the test as usual, for instance:\n    proxy->GetThreadProxy(0)->InvokeSomeTest(...)\n\n    // The profiler will stop and produce the output file here, when it goes out of scope.\n}\n\nThe build process invokes the Sandpiper compiler to generate a few files. One of those files contains symbolic information needed by the report generator. Unless the compiler is instructed otherwise, this file will be called myAppSymbols.csv\n\nAfter running the simpleTest program the profile data will be in the file simpleTest.profile.csv\n\nThis is how to invoke the parser to produce the report file simpleTest.report.pdrpt :\n\nInspectablesParser --profiler-report --profile simpleTest.profile.csv --symbols myAppSymbols.csv --sources C:\\MyRepo\\src\\pd --output simpleTest.report.pdrpt\n\nOpening the file simpleTest.report.pdrpt in VSCode will produce the views previously described. The Location column will include references to the source file myApp.pd . Clicking on that cell will open an editor window at the relevant source line. Just make sure the Sandpiper extension is installed.\n\n\nCollecting and parsing inspectables data\n\nThe ReadInspectables runtime API collects the values of all inspectable variables, either from the hardware or from the interpreter, in textual form. It is then up to the user to interpret the meaning of the hexadecimal string values describing the data. For complex types such as, say, an Ethernet packet this can be cumbersome. The InspectablesParser tool can simplify the task by parsing the data with the help of the symbols file.\n\nThere are two options in the tool, each parses the data and adds some type information. The first option is – pretty-print and will produce a text file, using a C++ compatible syntax. The second option is – inspectables-report and will produce a JSON-formatted report, to be used by the VScode report visualizer. Both cases require the – inspectables option for the raw data file, and the – symbols option for the symbols file.\n\nAdditionally, the inspectables-report option can reduce the size of the output report by ignoring the basic block control state variables. The option – no-control-state selects this behavior.\n\n\nExamples\n\nThe following C++ snippet shows how to use the ReadInspectables API.\n\nint main(...)\n{\n    PipeDream::ProxyDescription proxyDescription;\n\n    ...\n\n    std::shared_ptr<PipeDream::Proxy> proxy = PipeDream::CreateProxy(&proxyDescription);\n\n    ...\n\n    // Run the test as usual, for instance:\n    proxy->GetThreadProxy(0)->InvokeSomeTest(...)\n\n    // Invoke the API to collect the status of all inspectable variables\n    std::ostringstream str;\n    ReadInspectables(proxy, str);\n\n    ...\n\n}\n\nThe following command line examples assume that the inspectables data has been saved in the file simpleTest.inspectables.csv . This command line example uses the pretty-print output option:\n\nInspectablesParser --pretty-print --inspectables simpleTest.inspectables.csv --symbols myAppSymbols.csv --no-control-state 1 --output simpleTest.inspectables.txt\n\nThis command line example uses the inspectables-report output option:\n\nInspectablesParser --inspectables-report --inspectables simpleTest.inspectables.csv --symbols myAppSymbols.csv --output simpleTest.inspectables.report.pdrpt\n\n\nECC Error Injection\n\nECC error handling code can be verified by inserting errors during simulation. This can be accomplished in a SystemVerilog testbench by setting one of two counters directly on a memory instance. For example:\n\ndut.memory_instance_name.correctable_errors_to_inject_ff = 16;\n\nwill cause up to 16 correctable errors to be injected during memory writes.\n\nSimilarly:\n\ndut.memory_instance_name.uncorrectable_errors_to_inject_ff = 32;\n\nwill cause up to 32 uncorrectable errors to be injected during memory writes.\n\n\nInterpreter\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PIPE DREAM PROFILER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A tool used for runtime data collection and profiling in Sandpiper applications)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SANDPIPER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A compiler and toolchain for generating and analyzing code, specifically for applications like PipeDream Profiler)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INSPECTABLESPARSER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A tool for parsing inspectables data, providing pretty-print and inspectables-report options for analysis)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>C:\\MYREPO\\SRC\\MYAPP.PD<|>GEO<|>Location of the Sandpiper source file within the filesystem layout of a Sandpiper application)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>C:\\MYREPO\\SRC\\SIMPLETEST\\MAIN.CPP<|>GEO<|>Location of the host-side test code main file in a Sandpiper application)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ECC ERROR INJECTION<|>EVENT<|>A process for verifying ECC error handling code by inserting errors during simulation in SystemVerilog testbenches)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PIPE DREAM PROFILER<|>SANDPIPER<|>Pipe Dream Profiler is a tool developed as part of the Sandpiper toolchain for application profiling<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INSPECTABLESPARSER<|>SANDPIPER<|>InspectablesParser is used alongside Sandpiper applications for parsing inspectables data<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>C:\\MYREPO\\SRC\\MYAPP.PD<|>SANDPIPER<|>The location is part of the filesystem layout for Sandpiper applications, indicating where source files are stored<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>C:\\MYREPO\\SRC\\SIMPLETEST\\MAIN.CPP<|>PIPE DREAM PROFILER<|>This file location is where the runtime data collection object for Pipe Dream Profiler is added in a Sandpiper application<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ECC ERROR INJECTION<|>SANDPIPER<|>ECC Error Injection is a technique that can be tested within Sandpiper applications using SystemVerilog testbenches<|>4)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

It this case, it proves that unbounded f is equal to forall m. exists n. abs (f n) > m . With this fact available in the local scope, Z3 can prove the\nlemma. You want to use reveal_opaque carefully, since with\nhaving revealed it, Z3 has the problematic alternating quantifier\nin scope and could go into a matching loop. But, here, since the\nconclusion of the lemma is exactly the body of the quantifier, Z3\nquickly completes the proof. If even this proves to be\nproblematic, then you may have to resort to tactics.\n\n- Explicitly instantiate where needed Now, with our instantiation lemma in hand, we can precisly\ninstantiate the unboundedness hypothesis on f as needed. In the proof, there are two instantiations, at m and m1 . Note, we are still relying on some non-trivial quantifier\ninstantiation by Z3. Notably, the two assertions are important to\ninstantiate the existential quantifier in the returns clause. We’ll look at that in more detail shortly. But, by making the problematic definition opaque and instantiating\nit explicitly, our performance problem is gone—here’s what\nquery-stats shows now. (<input>(18,2-31,5))    Query-stats (AlexOpaque.find_above_for_g, 1)\n             succeeded in 46 milliseconds\n\n(<input>(18,2-31,5))    Query-stats (AlexOpaque.find_above_for_g, 1)\n             succeeded in 46 milliseconds\n\n\nThis wiki page provides more information on selectively revealing opaque definitions.\n\nFor completeness, we look at some other ways in which quantifier\ninstantiation works.\n\nInstead of making the definition of unbounded opaque, we could\nprotect the universal quantifier with a pattern using some symbol\nreserved for this purpose, as shown below.\n\nlet trigger (x:int) = True\n\nlet unbounded_alt (f: nat → int) = forall (m: nat). {:pattern (trigger m)} (exists (n:nat). abs (f n) > m)\n\nassume\nval ff : (z:(nat → int){unbounded_alt z})\n\nlet gg : (nat -> int) = fun x -> ff (x+1)\n\n#push-options \"--query_stats --fuel 0 --ifuel 0\"\nlet find_above_for_gg (m:nat) : Lemma(exists (i:nat). abs(gg i) > m) = \n  assert (unbounded_alt ff);\n  assert (trigger m);\n  eliminate exists (n:nat). abs(ff n) > m\n  returns exists (i:nat). abs(gg i) > m with _. begin\n    let m1 = abs(ff n) in\n    if n>=1 then assert (abs(gg (n-1)) > m)\n    else begin\n      assert (trigger m1);\n      eliminate exists (n1:nat). abs (ff n1) > m1\n      returns exists (i:nat). abs(gg i) > m with _. \n      begin\n        assert (abs (gg (n1-1)) > m)\n      end \n    end \n  end \n\n\n- We define a new function trigger x that is trivially true.\n\n- In unbounded_alt we decorate the universal quantifier with an\nexplicit pattern, {:pattern (trigger x)} . The pattern is not\nsemantically relevant—it’s only there to control how the\nquantifier is instantiated\n\n- In find_above_for_gg , whenever we want to instantiate the\nquantifier with a particular lower bound k , we assert trigger k . That gives Z3 an active term that mentions trigger which\nit then uses to instantiate the quantifier with our choice of k .\n\nThis style is not particularly pleasant, because it involves polluting\nour definitions with semantically irrelevant triggers. The selectively\nrevealing opaque definitions style is much preferred. However,\nartificial triggers can sometimes be useful.\n\nWe have an existential formula in the goal exists (i:nat). abs(g i) > m and Z3 will try to solve this by finding an active term to\ninstantiate i . In this case, the patterns Z3 picks is (g i) as\nwell the predicate (HasType i Prims.nat) , which the SMT encoding\nintroduces. Note, F* does not currently allow the existential\nquantifier in a returns annoation to be decorated with a\npattern—that will likely change in the future.\n\nSince g i is one of the patterns, by asserting abs (g (n - 1)) > m in one branch, and abs (g (n1 - 1)) > m in the other, Z3 has\nthe terms it needs to instantiate the quantifier with n - 1 in one\ncase, and n1 - 1 in the other case.\n\nIn fact, any assertion that mentions the g (n - 1) and g (n1 - 1) will do, even trivial ones, as the example below shows.\n\nlet find_above_for_g1 (m:nat) : Lemma(exists (i:nat). abs(g i) > m) = \n  instantiate_unbounded f m;\n  eliminate exists (n:nat). abs(f n) > m\n  returns exists (i:nat). abs(g i) > m with _. begin\n    let m1 = abs(f n) in\n    if n>=1 then assert (trigger (g (n-1)))\n    else begin\n      instantiate_unbounded f m1;\n      eliminate exists (n1:nat). abs (f n1) > m1\n      returns exists (i:nat). abs(g i) > m with _.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>Z3<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Z3 is a theorem prover used for formal verification in computer science.

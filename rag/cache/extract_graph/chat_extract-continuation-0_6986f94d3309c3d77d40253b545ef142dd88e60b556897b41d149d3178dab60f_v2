'Not a farthing less. A great many\nback-payments are included in it, I assure you. Will you do me that\nfavour?'\n\n'My dear sir,' said the other, shaking hands with him, 'I don't know\nwhat to say to such munifi----'\n\n'Don't say anything, please,' retorted Scrooge. 'Come and see me. Will\nyou come and see me?'\n\n'I will!' cried the old gentleman. And it was clear he meant to do it.\n\n'Thankee,' said Scrooge. 'I am much obliged to you. I thank you fifty\ntimes. Bless you!'\n\nHe went to church, and walked about the streets, and watched the people\nhurrying to and fro, and patted the children on the head, and questioned\nbeggars, and looked down into the kitchens of houses, and up to the\nwindows; and found that everything could yield him pleasure. He had\nnever dreamed that any walk--that anything--could give him so much\nhappiness. In the afternoon he turned his steps towards his nephew's\nhouse.\n\nHe passed the door a dozen times before he had the courage to go up and\nknock. But he made a dash and did it.\n\n'Is your master at home, my dear?' said Scrooge to the girl. 'Nice girl!\nVery.'\n\n'Yes, sir.'\n\n'Where is he, my love?' said Scrooge.\n\n'He's in the dining-room, sir, along with mistress. I'll show you\nupstairs, if you please.'\n\n'Thankee. He knows me,' said Scrooge, with his hand already on the\ndining-room lock. 'I'll go in here, my dear.'\n\nHe turned it gently, and sidled his face in round the door. They were\nlooking at the table (which was spread out in great array); for these\nyoung housekeepers are always nervous on such points, and like to see\nthat everything is right.\n\n'Fred!' said Scrooge.\n\nDear heart alive, how his niece by marriage started! Scrooge had\nforgotten, for the moment, about her sitting in the corner with the\nfootstool, or he wouldn't have done it on any account.\n\n'Why, bless my soul!' cried Fred, 'who's that?'\n\n[Illustration: _\"It's I, your uncle Scrooge. I have come to dinner. Will\nyou let me in, Fred?\"_]\n\n'It's I. Your uncle Scrooge. I have come to dinner. Will you let me in,\nFred?'\n\nLet him in! It is a mercy he didn't shake his arm off. He was at home in\nfive minutes. Nothing could be heartier. His niece looked just the same.\nSo did Topper when _he_ came. So did the plump sister when _she_ came.\nSo did every one when _they_ came. Wonderful party, wonderful games,\nwonderful unanimity, won-der-ful happiness!\n\nBut he was early at the office next morning. Oh, he was early there! If\nhe could only be there first, and catch Bob Cratchit coming late! That\nwas the thing he had set his heart upon.\n\nAnd he did it; yes, he did! The clock struck nine. No Bob. A quarter\npast. No Bob. He was full eighteen minutes and a half behind his time.\nScrooge sat with his door wide open, that he might see him come into the\ntank.\n\nHis hat was off before he opened the door; his comforter too. He was on\nhis stool in a jiffy, driving away with his pen, as if he were trying to\novertake nine o'clock.\n\n'Hallo!' growled Scrooge in his accustomed voice as near as he could\nfeign it. 'What do you mean by coming here at this time of day?'\n\n'I am very sorry, sir,' said Bob. 'I _am_ behind my time.'\n\n'You are!' repeated Scrooge. 'Yes, I think you are. Step this way, sir,\nif you please.'\n\n'It's only once a year, sir,' pleaded Bob, appearing from the tank. 'It\nshall not be repeated. I was making rather merry yesterday, sir.'\n\n'Now, I'll tell you what, my friend,' said Scrooge. 'I am not going to\nstand this sort of thing any longer. And therefore,' he continued,\nleaping from his stool, and giving Bob such a dig in the waistcoat that\nhe staggered back into the tank again--'and therefore I am about to\nraise your salary!'\n\nBob trembled, and got a little nearer to the ruler. He had a momentary\nidea of knocking Scrooge down with it, holding him, and calling to the\npeople in the court for help and a strait-waistcoat.\n\n'A merry Christmas, Bob!' said Scrooge, with an earnestness that could\nnot be mistaken, as he clapped him on the back. 'A merrier Christmas,\nBob, my good fellow, than I have given you for many a year! I'll raise\nyour salary, and endeavour to assist your struggling family, and we will\ndiscuss your affairs this very afternoon, over a Christmas bowl of\nsmoking bishop, Bob!

Not all of this may make sense to\nyou—that’s okay, you’ll learn about it as we go.\n\n- A core language of total functions with full dependent types,\nincluding an extensional form of type conversion, indexed inductive\ntypes, and pattern matching, recursive functions with semantic\ntermination checking, dependent refinement types and subtyping, and\npolymorphism over a predicative hierarchy of universes.\n\n- A system of user-defined indexed effects, for modeling,\nencapsulating, and statically reasoning about various forms of\ncomputational effects, including a primitive notion of general\nrecursion and divergence, as well as an open system of user-defined\neffects, with examples including state, exceptions, concurrency,\nalgebraic effects, and several others.\n\n- A built-in encoding of a classical fragment of F*’s logic into the\nfirst order logic of an SMT solver, allowing many proofs to be\nautomatically discharged.\n\n- A reflection within F* of the syntax and proof state of F*, enabling\nMeta-F* programs to manipulate F* syntax and proof goals and for\nusers to build proofs interactively with tactics.\n\nIn practice, rather than a single language, the F* ecosystem is also a\ncollection of domain-specific languages (DSLs). A common use of F* is\nto embed within it programming languages at different levels of\nabstraction or for specific programming tasks, and for the embedded\nlanguage to be engineered with domain-specific reasoning, proof\nautomation, and compilation backends. Some examples include:\n\n- Low*, an shallowly embedded DSL for sequential programming against a\nC-like memory model including explicit memory management on the\nstack and heap; a Hoare logic for partial correctness based on\nimplicit dynamic frames; and a custom backend (Karamel) to compile\nLow* programs to C for further compilation by off-the-shelf C\ncompilers.\n\n- EverParse, a shallow embedding of a DSL (layered on top of the Low*\nDSL) of parser and serializer combinators, for low-level binary\nformats.\n\n- Vale, a deeply embedded DSL for structured programming in a\nuser-defined assembly language, with a Hoare logic for total\ncorrectness, and a printer to emit verified programs in a assembly\nsyntax compatible with various standard assemblers.\n\n- Steel, a shallow embedding of concurrency as an effect in F*, with\nan extensible concurrent separation logic for partial correctness as\na core program logic, and proof automation built using a combination\nof Meta-F* tactics, higher-order unification, and SMT.\n\n- Pulse, a successor of Steel, a DSL with custom syntax and\ntypechecking algorithm, providing proofs in a small but highly\nexpressive core logic for mutable state and concurrency called\nPulseCore, formalized entirely in terms of pure and ghost functions\nin F*.\n\nTo get a taste of F*, let’s dive right in with some examples. At this\nstage, we don’t expect you to understand these examples in detail,\nthough it should give you a flavor of what is possible with F*.\n\nDependently typed programming enables one to more precisely capture\nproperties and invariants of a program using types. Here’s a classic\nexample: the type vec a n represents an n -dimensional vector\nof a -typed elements; or, more simply, a list of n values each\nof type a . Like other dependently typed languages, F* supports\ninductively defined definitions of types.\n\ntype vec (a:Type) : nat -> Type =\n  | Nil : vec a 0\n  | Cons : #n:nat -> hd:a -> tl:vec a n -> vec a (n + 1)\n\n\nOperations on a vectors can be given types that describe their\nbehavior in terms of vector lengths.\n\nFor example, here’s a recursive function append to concatenate two\nvectors. Its type shows that the resulting vector has a length that is\nthe sum of the lengths of the input vectors.\n\nlet rec append #a #n #m (v1:vec a n) (v2:vec a m)\n  : vec a (n + m)\n  = match v1 with\n    | Nil -> v2\n    | Cons hd tl -> Cons hd (append tl v2)\n\n\nOf course, once a function like append is defined, it can be used\nto define other operations and its type helps in proving further\nproperties. For example, it’s easy to show that reversing a vector\ndoes not change its length.\n\nlet rec reverse #a #n (v:vec a n)\n  : vec a n\n  = match v with\n    | Nil -> Nil\n    | Cons hd tl -> append (reverse tl) (Cons hd Nil)\n\n\nFinally, to get an element from a vector, one can program a selector\nwhose type also includes a refinement type to specify that the index i is less than the length of the vector.\n\nlet rec get #a #n (i:nat{i < n}) (v:vec a n)\n  : a\n  = let Cons hd tl =\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>F*<|>ORGANIZATION<|>F* is a dependently typed programming language that serves multiple roles including a general-purpose programming language, a compiler, a proof assistant, a program verification engine, and a metaprogramming system)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OCAML<|>ORGANIZATION<|>OCaml is one of the target languages to which F* programs can be translated for execution)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>F#<|>ORGANIZATION<|>F# is another target language for F* programs, enabling their execution)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>C<|>ORGANIZATION<|>C is a target language for F* programs, particularly for execution after translation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WASM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Wasm (WebAssembly) is a target compilation output for F* programs, facilitating their execution on the web)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LOW*<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Low* is a domain-specific language (DSL) within F* for sequential programming and explicit memory management, with a custom backend to compile to C)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EVERPARSE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>EverParse is a DSL for parsing and serializing low-level binary formats, built on top of Low*)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VALE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Vale is a deeply embedded DSL in F* for structured programming in assembly language, with support for total correctness proofs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STEEL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Steel is a shallow embedding of concurrency as an effect in F*, with a concurrent separation logic for partial correctness)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PULSE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Pulse is a DSL succeeding Steel, focusing on mutable state and concurrency with a core logic called PulseCore)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>F*<|>OCAML<|>F* can compile programs into OCaml for execution<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>F*<|>F#<|>F* supports F# as a target language for program execution<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>F*<|>C<|>F* programs can be translated into C for further compilation and execution<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>F*<|>WASM<|>F* allows for programs to be compiled into WebAssembly (Wasm) for web execution<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>F*<|>LOW*<|>Low* is a DSL within the F* ecosystem for C-like sequential programming<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>F*<|>EVERPARSE<|>EverParse is a DSL developed within F* for binary format parsing and serialization<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>F*<|>VALE<|>Vale, a DSL for assembly language programming, is part of the F* ecosystem<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>F*<|>STEEL<|>Steel is a concurrency DSL within F*, showcasing the language's support for concurrent programming<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>F*<|>PULSE<|>Pulse is a successor to Steel, emphasizing mutable state and concurrency within F*<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

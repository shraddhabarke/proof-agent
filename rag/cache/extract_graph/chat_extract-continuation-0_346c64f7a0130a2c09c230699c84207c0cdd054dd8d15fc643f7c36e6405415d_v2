So, one often writes a:Type u#a , where a is a regular variable and u#a is the universe level of the type\nof a .\n\nThe pair type below is parameterized by a:Type u#a and b:Type u#b and constructs a type in u#(max a b) .\n\ntype pair (a:Type u#a) (b:Type u#b) : Type u#(max a b) =\n  | Pair : fst:a -> snd:b -> pair a b\n\n\n- The fst field is in u#a and so we have u#a ≤ u#(max a b) .\n\n- The snd field is in u#b and so we have u#b ≤ u#(max a b) .\n\nThe top type below packages a value at any type a:Type u#a with its type.\n\nnoeq\ntype top : Type u#(a + 1) =\n  | Top : a:Type u#a -> v:a -> top\n\n\n- The a field of Top is in u#(a + 1) while the v field\nis in u#a . So, top itself is in u#(max (a + 1) a) ,\nwhich simplifies to u#(a + 1) .\n\nOne intuition for why this is so is that from a value of type t : top one can write a function that computes a value of type Type u#a , i.e., Top?.a t . So, if instead we have top: Type u#a and t:top , then Top?.a : top -> Type u#a , which would break\nthe stratification of universes, since from a value top in\nuniverse u#a , we would be able to project out a value in Type u#(a + 1) , which leads to a paradox, as we’ll see next.\n\nWhat follows is quite technical and you only need to know that the\nuniverse system exists to avoid paradoxes, not how such paradoxes are\nconstructed.\n\nType theory has its roots in Bertrand Russell’s The Principles\nof Mathematics , which\nexplores the logical foundations of mathematics and set theory. In\nthis work, Russell proposed the paradoxical set Δ whose\nelements are exactly all the sets that don’t contain themselves and\nconsidered whether or not Δ contained itself. This\nself-referential construction is paradoxical since:\n\n- If Δ ∈ Δ , then since the only sets in Δ are the sets that don’t contain themselves, we can\nconclude that Δ ∉ Δ .\n\n- On the other hand, if Δ ∉ Δ , then since Δ contains all sets that don’t contain themselves, we\ncan conclude that Δ ∈ Δ .\n\nTo avoid such paradoxes, Russell formulated a stratified system of\ntypes to prevent nonsensical constructions that rely on\nself-reference. The universe levels of modern type theories serve much\nthe same purpose.\n\nIn fact, as the construction below shows, if it were possible to break\nthe stratification of universes in F*, then one can code up Russell’s Δ set and prove False . This construction is derived\nfrom Thorsten Altenkirch’s Agda code . Liam\nO’Connor also provides some useful context and comparison . Whereas\nthe Agda code uses a special compiler pragma to enable unsound\nimpredicativity, in F* we show how a user-introduced axiom can\nsimulate impredicativity and enable the same paradox.\n\nConsider the following axioms that intentionally break the\nstratification of F*’s universe system. We’ll need the following\ningredients:\n\n- A strictly positive type constructor lower that takes a type in\nany universe a:Type u#a , and returns a type in u#0 . Note,\nwe covered strictly positive type functions, previously .\n\nassume\nval lower ([@@@strictly_positive] a:Type u#a) : Type u#0\n\n\n- Assume there is a function called inject , which takes value of\ntype x:a and returns value of type lower a .\n\nassume\nval inject (#a:Type u#a) (x:a) : lower a\n\n\n- lower and inject on their own are benign (e.g., let lower _ = unit and let inject _ = () ). But, now if we assume we\nhave a function project that is the inverse of inject , then\nwe’ve opened the door to paradoxes.\n\nassume\nval project (#a:Type u#a) (x:lower a) : a\n\nassume\nval inj_proj (#a:Type u#a) (x:a)\n  : Lemma (project (inject x) == x)\n\n\nTo show the paradox, we’ll define a notion of set in terms of a\nform of set comprehensions f: x -> set , where x:Type u#0 is\nthe domain of the comprehension, supposedly bounding the cardinality\nof the set.  We’ll subvert the universe system by treating set as\nliving in universe u#0 , even though its constructor Set has a\nfield x:Type u#0 that has universe level u#1\n\nnoeq\ntype _set : Type u#1 =\n  | Set : x:Type0 -> f:(x -> set) -> _set\nand set : Type0 = lower _set\n\n\nThis construction allows us to define many useful sets. For example,\nthe empty set zero uses the empty type False as the domain of\nits comprehension and so has no\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

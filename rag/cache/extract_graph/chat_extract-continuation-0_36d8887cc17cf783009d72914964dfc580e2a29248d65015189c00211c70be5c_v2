\"bake-in\" the interpretation of the individual actions in\n   ``interp``, we can also abstract the semantics of the actions using\n   an idea similar to exception handling, allowing the context to\n   customize the semantics of the actions simply by providing a\n   different handler.\n\nExercise\n--------\n\nProve that the ``interp`` function interprets equivalent trees ``f``\nand ``g`` to

produces\nequivalent results when applied to equivalent trees, using functional\nextensionality, we can prove that equivalent trees are actually\nprovably equal, i.e., ``equiv x y ==> x == y``.\n\nThis is a little technical, since although functional extensionality\nis a theorem in F*, it is only true of :math:`\\eta`-expanded functions.\n\nTry to use

Computation Trees: Nondeterminism and Concurrency\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nAs a final bit, we show that representing computations as trees is not\njust useful from a perspective of genericity and code re-use.\nComputation trees expose the structure of a computation in a way that\nallows us to manipulate it, e.g., interpreting actions in an\nalternative semantics.\n\nIn this section, we enhance our computation trees to support\nnon-deterministic choice, i.e., given pair of computations ``l, r:tree\nacts a``, we can non-deterministically choose to evaluate ``l`` or\n``r``. With this capability, we can also express some models of\nconcurrency, e.g., a semantics that interleaves imperative actions\nfrom several threads.\n\nLet's start by enhancing our ``tree`` type to now include an node ``Or\nl r``, to represent non-deterministic choice between ``l`` and ``r``.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Part2.Par.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: tree$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: tree$\n\nAs before, we can define ``return`` and ``bind``, this time in\n``bind`` we sequence ``g`` after both choices in ``Or``.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Part2.Par.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: return and bind$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: return and bind$\n\nWhat's more interesting is that, in addition to sequential\ncomposition, we can also define parallel composition of a pair of\ncomputations using ``par f g``, as shown below.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Part2.Par.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: par$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: par$\n\nThere's quite a lot going on here, so let's break it down a bit:\n\n  * The functions ``l_par f g`` and ``r_par f g`` are mutually\n    recursive and define an interleaving semantics of the actions in\n    ``f`` and ``g``.\n\n  * ``l_par f g`` is left-biased: picking an action from ``f`` to\n    execute first (if any are left); while ``r_par f g`` is\n    right-biased, picking an action from ``g`` to execute first.\n\n  * Consider the ``DoThen`` case in ``l_par``: if picks the head\n    action ``a`` from ``f`` and the recurses in the continuation with\n    ``r_par (k x) g``, to prefer executing first an action from ``g``\n    rather than ``k x``. The ``DoThen`` case of ``r_par`` is\n    symmetric.\n\n  * For ``l_par``, in the non-deterministic choice case (``Or``), we\n    interleave either choice of ``f`` with ``g``, and ``r_par`` is\n    symmetric.\n\n  * Finally, we define parallel composition ``par f g`` as the\n    non-deterministic choice of either the left-biased or right-biased\n    interleaving of the actions of ``f`` and ``g``. This fixes the\n    semantics of parallel composition to a round-robin scheduling of\n    the actions between the threads, but one could imagine\n    implementing other kinds of schedulers too.\n\nAs before,\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>INTERP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A function in F* that interprets computation trees as state-passing functions, allowing for a customizable semantics of actions similar to exception handling)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FSTAR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A programming language designed for program verification that supports the manipulation and interpretation of computation trees)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COMPUTATION TREE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A representation of computations in F* that allows for manipulation and interpretation of actions within a computation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NONDETERMINISM<|>EVENT<|>An enhancement to computation trees in F* that allows for non-deterministic choice between computations, enabling models of concurrency)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CONCURRENCY<|>EVENT<|>A model of computation in F* where actions from several threads are interleaved, enabled by non-deterministic choice in computation trees)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INTERP<|>COMPUTATION TREE<|>INTERP function interprets computation trees, providing a customizable semantics for actions<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NONDETERMINISM<|>COMPUTATION TREE<|>Non-determinism is introduced to computation trees to support models of concurrency<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CONCURRENCY<|>NONDETERMINISM<|>Concurrency in F* is enabled by non-deterministic choice in computation trees<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

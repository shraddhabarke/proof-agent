Each of these is an\ninterface file that pairs with a module implementation in a\ncorresponding ``.fst`` file.\n\nAn interface (``.fsti``) is very similar to a module implementation\n(``.fst``): it can contain all the elements that a module can,\nincluding inductive ``type`` definitions; ``let`` and ``let rec``\ndefinitions; ``val`` declarations; etc. However, unlike module\nimplementations, an interface is allowed to declare a symbol ``val f :\nt`` without any corresponding definition of ``f``. This makes ``f``\nabstract to the rest of the interface and all client modules, i.e.,\n``f`` is simply assumed to have type ``t`` without any definition. The\ndefinition of ``f`` is provided in the ``.fst`` file and checked to\nhave type ``t``, ensuring that a client module's assumption of ``f:t``\nis backed by a suitable definition.\n\nTo see how interfaces work, we'll look at the design of the **bounded\ninteger** modules ``FStar.UInt32``, ``FStar.UInt64``, and the like,\nbuilding our own simplified versions by way of illustration.\n\n.. _Machine_integers:\n\nBounded Integers\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nThe F* primitive type ``int`` is an unbounded mathematical\ninteger. When compiling a program to, say, OCaml, ``int`` is compiled\nto a \"big integer\", implemented by OCaml's `ZArith package\n<https://opam.ocaml.org/packages/zarith/>`_. However, the ``int`` type\ncan be inefficient and in some scenarios (e.g., when compiling F*\nto C) one may want to work with bounded integers that can always be\nrepresented in machine word. ``FStar.UInt32.t`` and ``FStar.UInt64.t``\nare types from the standard library whose values can always be\nrepresented as 32- and 64-bit unsigned integers, respectively.\n\nArithmetic operations on 32-bit unsigned integers (like addition) are\ninterpreted modulo ``2^32``. However, for many applications, one wants\nto program in a discipline that ensures that there is no unintentional\narithmetic overflow, i.e., we'd like to use bounded integers for\nefficiency, and by proving that their operations don't overflow we can\nreason about bounded integer terms without using modular arithmetic.\n\n.. note::\n\n   Although we don't discuss them here, F*'s libraries also provide\n   signed integer types that can be compiled to the corresponding\n   signed integters in C. Avoiding overflow on signed integer\n   arithmetic is not just a matter of ease of reasoning, since signed\n   integer overflow is undefined behavior in C.\n\nInterface: UInt32.fsti\n----------------------\n\nThe interface ``UInt32`` begins like any module with the\nmodule's name. Although this could be inferred from the name of the file\n(``UInt32.fsti``, in this case), F* requires the name to be explicit.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/UInt32.fsti\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: t$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: t$\n                \n``UInt32`` provides one abstract type ``val t : eqtype``, the type of\nour bounded integer. Its type says that it supports decidable\nequality, but no definition of ``t`` is revaled in the interface.\n\nThe operations on ``t`` are specified in terms of a logical model that\nrelates ``t`` to bounded mathematical integers, in particular\n``u32_nat``, a natural number less than ``pow2 32``.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/UInt32.fsti\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: bounds$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: bounds$\n\n.. note::\n\n   Unlike interfaces in languages like OCaml, interfaces in F* *can*\n   include ``let`` and ``let rec`` definitions. As we see in\n   ``UInt32``, these definitions are often useful for giving precise\n   specifications to the other operations whose signatures appear in\n   the interface.\n\nTo relate our abstract type ``t`` to ``u32_nat``, the interface\nprovides two coercions ``v`` and ``u`` that go back and forth between\n``t`` and ``u32_nat``. The lemma signatures ``vu_inv`` and\n``uv_inv`` require ``v`` and ``u`` to be mutually inverse, meaning\nthat ``t`` and ``u32_nat`` are in 1-1 correspondence.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/UInt32.fsti\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: vu$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: vu$\n\nModular addition and subtraction\n................................\n\nAddition and subtraction on ``t`` values are defined modulo ``pow2\n32``. This is specified by the signatures of ``add_mod`` and\n``sub_mod`` below.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/UInt32.fsti\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: add_mod$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: add_mod$\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/UInt32.fsti\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: sub_mod$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: sub_mod$\n\nBounds-checked addition and subtraction\n.......................................\n\nAlthough\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>F* STANDARD LIBRARY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A collection of interface and module implementation files within the ulib folder, facilitating various programming functionalities)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UINT32<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A module in F* standard library providing operations and types for 32-bit unsigned integers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UINT64<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A module in F* standard library providing operations and types for 64-bit unsigned integers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OCAML<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A programming language to which F* programs can be compiled, using big integers through the ZArith package)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ZARITH PACKAGE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A package in OCaml for big integer arithmetic)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>UINT32<|>F* STANDARD LIBRARY<|>UINT32 is a part of the F* standard library, providing bounded integer functionality<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>UINT64<|>F* STANDARD LIBRARY<|>UINT64 is a part of the F* standard library, providing bounded integer functionality<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OCAML<|>ZARITH PACKAGE<|>OCaml uses the ZArith package for implementing big integer arithmetic<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

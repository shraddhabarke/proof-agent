E.g., if the interface\n    contains ``val f : tf`` followed by ``val g : tg``, then the\n    implementation of ``f`` must precede the implementation of ``g``.\n\nAlso, remember that if you are writing ``val`` declarations in an\ninterface, it is a good idea to be explicit about universe levels. See\n:ref:`here for more discussion <Part2_tips_for_universes>`.\n\nOther issues with interleaving that may help in debugging compiler\nerrors with interfaces:\n\n  * `Issue 2020 <https://github.com/FStarLang/FStar/issues/2020>`_\n  * `Issue 1770 <https://github.com/FStarLang/FStar/issues/1770>`_\n  * `Issue 959  <https://github.com/FStarLang/FStar/issues/959>`_\n\nComparison with machine integers in the F* library\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nF*'s standard library includes ``FStar.UInt32``, whose interface is\nsimilar, though more extensive than the ``UInt32`` shown in this\nchapter. For example, ``FStar.UInt32`` also includes multiplication,\ndivision, modulus, bitwise logical operations, etc.\n\nThe implementation of ``FStar.UInt32`` chooses a representation for\n``FStar.UInt32.t`` that is similar to ``u32_nat``, though the F*\ncompiler has special knowledge of this module and treats\n``FStar.UInt32.t`` as a primitive type and compiles it and its\noperations in a platform-specific way to machine integers. The\nimplementation of ``FStar.UInt32`` serves only to prove that its\ninterface is logically consistent by providing a model in terms of\nbounded natural numbers.\n\nThe library also provides several other unsigned machine integer types\nin addition to ``FStar.UInt32``, including ``FStar.UInt8``,\n``FStar.UInt16``, and ``FStar.UInt64``.  F* also has several signed\nmachine integer types.\n\nAll of these modules are very similar, but not being first-class\nentities in the language, there is no way to define a general\ninterface that is instantiated by all these modules. In fact, all\nthese variants are generated by a script from a common template.\n\nAlthough interfaces are well-suited to simple patterns of information\nhiding and modular structure, as we'll learn next, typeclasses are\nmore powerful and enable more generic solutions, though sometimes\nrequiring the use of higher-order code.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>FSTAR.UINT32<|>ORGANIZATION<|>FStar.UInt32 is part of F*'s standard library, offering an interface for unsigned 32-bit integers including operations like multiplication, division, and bitwise logical operations)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FSTAR.UINT8<|>ORGANIZATION<|>FStar.UInt8 is part of F*'s standard library, representing unsigned 8-bit integers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FSTAR.UINT16<|>ORGANIZATION<|>FStar.UInt16 is part of F*'s standard library, representing unsigned 16-bit integers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FSTAR.UINT64<|>ORGANIZATION<|>FStar.UInt64 is part of F*'s standard library, representing unsigned 64-bit integers)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FSTAR.UINT32<|>FSTAR.UINT8<|>Both are unsigned machine integer types provided by F*'s standard library<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FSTAR.UINT32<|>FSTAR.UINT16<|>Both are unsigned machine integer types provided by F*'s standard library<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FSTAR.UINT32<|>FSTAR.UINT64<|>Both are unsigned machine integer types provided by F*'s standard library<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FSTAR.UINT8<|>FSTAR.UINT16<|>Both are unsigned machine integer types provided by F*'s standard library<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FSTAR.UINT8<|>FSTAR.UINT64<|>Both are unsigned machine integer types provided by F*'s standard library<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FSTAR.UINT16<|>FSTAR.UINT64<|>Both are unsigned machine integer types provided by F*'s standard library<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

N is the number of cases in the switch statement (3 in the example below).

C[i] is 1 if the mux statement was executed with condition equal to i (0 otherwise).

Each basic block is a list of statements with the property that if a thread executes the first statement in the list, the thread will execute every statement in the list.\n\nThe decomposition of code into basic blocks occurs after an important transformation: if-conversion. If-conversion replaces if and switch statements with the ternary operator, as illustrated below.\n\nbool b;\nuint32 x;\n\n// Original\nif (b)\n{\n    x = 3;\n}\n\n// After if-conversion\nx = b ? 3 : x;\n\nThe language constructs that cause new basic blocks to be introduced are:\n\n- Calls to non-inline functions\n- Returns from non-inline functions\n- Loops (including atomic do )\n- reorder\n\nCoverage of a basic block is 1 if the basic block was ever executed, and is 0 otherwise.\n\n\nBlock Coverage Lower Bound\n\nSome code coverage tools report block coverage (before if-conversion). Sandpiper code coverage tools do not. However, the following lower bound holds:\n\nIf basic block coverage (after if-conversion) is 100% then block coverage (before if-conversion) is greater than or equal to branch coverage.\n\nFor example, in the function below there are 4 relevant executions:\n\n1. b = false, c = false\n2. b = false, c = true\n3. b = true, c = false\n4. b = true, c = true\n\n- If all 4 executions occur, then branch coverage is 4/4 and block coverage is 5/5\n- If executions 1 and 2 occur, then branch coverage is 1/4 and block coverage is 2/5\n- If executions 1 and 3 occur, then branch coverage is 3/4 and block coverage is 4/5\n\nvoid F(bool b, bool c)\n{\n    // Block 1\n\n    if (b)\n    {\n        // Block 2\n\n        if (c)\n        {\n            // Block 3\n        }\n\n        // Block 4\n    }\n\n    // Block 5\n}\n\n\nCondition Coverage\n\nCondition coverage seeks to break down branch conditions into the constituent Boolean sub-expressions and check for coverage on these Boolean sub-expressions. For example, this would break down the condition (A && B) to the Boolean sub-expressions A and B . Sandpiper implements a form of condition coverage called Modified Condition/Decision Coverage (MC/DC) [1], also referred to as Focused Expression Coverage (FEC) [2]. The idea is to check that each Boolean sub-expression independently affects the outcome of the branch condition [3]. For details, see [3], [4], and [5].\n\nFrom a user perspective, coverage for each Boolean sub-expression is (T + F) / 2 . T is 1 if the Boolean sub-expression evalutes to true and the associated non-masking condition evalutes to true. F is 1 if the Boolean sub-expression evalutes to false and the associated non-masking condition evalutes to true. The non-masking conditions are determined by the compiler under the rules of MC/DC. Each of these are specified in the coverage report by the “case” field. For example:\n\n(A)_1 with non-masking condition (B)\n\nThis specifies the A is true case with associated non-masking condition B .\n\nIn some cases (specifically when a sub-expression operates in both inverting and non-inverting mode such as in an XOR [6]), condition coverage also tracks whether the Boolean sub-expression is seen to cause the original top-level condition to evaluate to both true and false. For example:\n\n(A)_0 with non-masking condition (X)\n(A)_1 with non-masking condition (X)\n(A)->0 with non-masking condition (X)\n(A)->1 with non-masking condition (X)\n\nThe case (A)->0 with non-masking condition (X) is covered when the original top-level condition evalutes to false and the non-masking condition X evalutes to true. The case (A)->1 with non-masking condition (X) is covered when the original top-level condition evalutes to true and the non-masking condition X evalutes to true. For these sub-expressions, condition coverage is (T + F + ->T +\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

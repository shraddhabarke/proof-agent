In this chapter, we see how the termination check\narises from inductive types and structural recursion. Just as with\n:ref:`equality <Part2_equality>`, termination checking, a core feature\nof F*'s logic and proof system, finds its foundation in inductive\ntypes.\n\nFor more technical background on this topic, the following resources\nmay be useful:\n\n  * `Constructing Recursion Operators in Type Theory, L.

Since\nwell-founded relations have no infinite descending chains, every chain\nof recursive calls related by such a relation must eventually\nterminate. However, this built-in well-founded relation, written\n``<<`` or ``precedes``, is a derived notion.\n\nIn its most primitive form, the well-foundedness of a relation can be\nexpressed in terms of an inductive type ``acc`` (short for\n\"accessible\") shown below.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Part2.WellFounded.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: acc$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: acc$\n\nThe type ``acc`` is parameterized by a type ``a``; a binary relation\n``r: a -> a -> Type`` on ``a``; and an element of the type\n``x:a``. Informally, the relation ``r y x`` is provable when ``y``\nis \"smaller\" than ``x``.\n\nThe ``acc`` type has just one constructor ``AccIntro``, whose only\nargument is a function of type ``y:a -> r y x -> acc r\ny``. Intuitively, this says that in order to build an instance of\n``acc r x0``, you have to provide a function which can build a proof\nof ``acc r x1`` for all ``x1:a`` smaller than ``x0``. The only way to\nbuild such a function is one can avoid infinite regress, is if\nthe chain ``x0 r x1 r x2 r ...``, eventually terminates in some ``xn``\nsuch that there are no elements smaller than it according to ``r``.\n\nIn other words, if one can prove ``acc r x`` for all ``x:a``, then\nthis precisely captures the condition that there are no infinite\ndescending ``r``-related chains in ``a``, or that ``r`` is\nwell-founded. This is exactly what the definition below says, where\n``is_well_founded`` is a classical (SMT-automatable) variant of\n``well_founded``.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Part2.WellFounded.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: well_founded$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: well_founded$\n\nWell-founded Recursion\n----------------------\n\nGiven a relation ``r`` and proof of ``p:acc r x`` , one can define a\nrecursive function on ``x`` whose termination can be established\npurely in terms of structural recursion on the proof ``p``, even\nthough the function may not itself be structurally recursive on ``x``.\n\nThe combinator ``fix_F`` shown below illustrates this at work:\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Part2.WellFounded.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: fix_F$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: fix_F$\n\nIf ``f`` is a function such that every recursive call in the\ndefinition of ``f x`` is on an argument ``y``, such that that ``y`` is\nsmaller than ``x`` according to some relation ``r``; and if starting\nfrom some argument ``x\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>F*<|>ORGANIZATION<|>F* is a programming language with a logic and proof system that checks recursive functions for termination based on inductive types and structural recursion)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>L.

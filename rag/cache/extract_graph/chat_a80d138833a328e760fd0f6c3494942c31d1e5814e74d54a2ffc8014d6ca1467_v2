But, the program looks obscure “just”\nbecause it’s using a convoluted syntax to call bind . Many\nlanguages, most famously Haskell, provide specialized syntax to\nsimplify writing computations that work with APIs like bind and return . F* provides some syntactic sugar to handle this too.\n\nThe definition below defines a function with a special name let! . Names of this form, the token let followed by a sequence\nof one or more operator characters such as ! , ? , @ , $ , < , and > are monadic let-binding operators.\n\nlet (let!) = bind\n\n\nWith let! in scope, the following syntactic sugar becomes available:\n\n- Instead of writing bind f (fun x -> e) you can write let! x = f in e .\n\n- Instead of writing bind f (fun _ -> e) you can write f ;! e , i.e., a semicolon followed the sequence of operator characters\nuses in the monadic let-binding operator.\n\n- Instead of writing bind f (fun x -> match x with ...) , you can\nwrite match! f with ...\n\n- Instead of writing bind f (fun x -> if x then ...) , you can\nwrite if! f then ...\n\nSee this file MonadicLetBindings.fst for more details an examples of the syntactic sugar.\n\nUsing this syntactic sugar, we come to our final version of read_and_increment , where now, hopefully, the imperative-looking\nstate updates make the intent of our program clear.\n\nlet read_and_increment : st int =\n  let! x = read in\n  write (x + 1) ;!\n  return x\n\n\nHaving structured our programs with return and bind , larger st computations can be built from smaller ones, without having to\nworry about how to plumb the state through—that’s handled once and\nfor all by our combinators.\n\nlet inc_twice : st int = \n  let! x = read_and_increment in\n  read_and_increment ;!\n  return x\n\n\nIt turns out that every API that is structured like our st is an\ninstance of a general pattern called a monad , an algebraic\nstructure. Specifically, a monad consists of:\n\n- A type operator m : Type -> Type\n\n- A function return (#a:Type) (x:a) : m a\n\n- A function bind (#a #b:Type) (f:m a) (g: a -> m b) : m b\n\nwhich satisfy the following laws, where ~ is some suitable\nequivalence relation on m a\n\n- Left identity: bind (return x) f ~ f\n\n- Right identity: bind f return ~ f\n\n- Associativity: bind f1 (fun x -> bind (f2 x) f3) ~ bind (bind f1 f2) f3\n\nIts easy to prove that st , return , and bind satisfy these\nlaws in F*, where we pick the equivalence relation to equate functions\nthat take equal arguments to equal results.\n\nlet feq #a #b (f g : a -> b) = forall x. f x == g x\nlet left_identity #a #b (x:a) (g: a -> st b)\n  : Lemma ((let! v = return x in g v) `feq` g x)\n  = ()\nlet right_identity #a (f:st a)\n  : Lemma ((let! x = f in return x) `feq` f)\n  = ()\nlet associativity #a #b #c (f1:st a) (f2:a -> st b) (f3:b -> st c)\n  : Lemma ((let! x = f1 in let! y = f2 x in f3 y) `feq`\n           (let! y = (let! x = f1 in f2 x) in f3 y))\n  = ()\n\n\nThese laws are practically useful in that they can catch bugs in our\nimplementations of the combinators. For instance, suppose we were to\nwrite bind_buggy below, which like in inc_twice_buggy ,\nmistakenly re-uses the old state s0 when calling g —in this\ncase, the right_identity law below cannot be proved.\n\nlet bind_buggy #a #b\n               (f: st a)\n               (g: a -> st b)\n  : st b\n  = fun s0 ->\n      let x, s1 = f s0 in\n      g x s0\n[@@expect_failure]\nlet right_identity_fail #a (f:st a)\n  : Lemma (bind_buggy f return `feq` f)\n  = ()\n\n\nWe can also prove laws about how the stateful actions, read and write , interact with each other in sequential composition.\n\nlet redundant_read_elim ()\n  : Lemma ((read;! read) `feq` read)\n  = ()\n\nlet redundant_write_elim (x y:int)\n  : Lemma ((write x ;! write y) `feq` write y)\n  = ()\n\nlet read_write_noop ()\n  : Lemma ((let! x = read in write x) `feq` return ())\n  = ()\n\n\nThat completes our tour of our very first monad, the state monad.\n\nMake the st type generic, so that instead of the state being fixed\nto a single integer value, it can be used with any type for the\nstate. I.e., define st (s:Type) (a:Type) : Type , where s is\nthe type of the state.\n\nAdapt the full development seen above to work with st s , including\nproving the various laws.\n\nExercise file\n\nAnswer\n\nmodule Part2.ST\n\nlet st s a = s -> a & s\n\nlet read #\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_a80d138833a328e760fd0f6c3494942c31d1e5814e74d54a2ffc8014d6ca1467_v2"}

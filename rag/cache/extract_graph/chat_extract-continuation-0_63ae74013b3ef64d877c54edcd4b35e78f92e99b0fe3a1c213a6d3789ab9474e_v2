These\ntypes are called *inductive types*, or, more informally,\ndatatypes. We'll also learn how to define functions over these\ninductive types by pattern matching and to prove properties about\nthem.\n\n.. note::\n\n   We'll only cover the most basic forms of inductive types here. In\n   particular, the types we show here will not make use of indexing or\n   any other form of dependent types---we'll leave that for a later\n   chapter.\n\nEnumerations\n^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nWe've seen that ``unit`` is the type with just one element ``()`` and\nthat ``bool`` is the type with two elements, ``true`` and ``false``.\n\nYou can define your own types with an enumeration of elements, like so.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Part1.Inductives.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: three\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: three\n\nThis introduces a new type ``three : Type``, and three *distinct*\nconstants ``One_of_three : three``, ``Two_of_three : three``,\n``Three_of_three : three``. These constants are also called\n\"constructors\" or \"data constructors\". The name of a constructor must\nbegin with an uppercase letter.\n\n.. note::\n\n   In this case, it may seem redundant to have to write the type of\n   each constructor repeatedlyâ€”of course they're all just constructors\n   of the type ``three``. In this case, F* will allow you to just\n   write\n\n   .. code-block:: fstar\n\n      type three =\n        | One_of_three\n        | Two_of_three\n        | Three_of_three\n\n   As we start to use indexed types, each constructor can build a\n   different instance of the defined type, so it will be important to\n   have a way to specify the result type of each constructor. For\n   uniformity, throughout this book, we'll always annotate the types\n   of constructors, even when not strictly necessary.\n\nF* can prove that they are distinct and that these are the only terms\nof type ``three``.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Part1.Inductives.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: assert\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: assert\n\nTo write functions that case analyze these new types, one uses the\n``match`` construct. The syntax of ``match`` in F* is very similar to\nOCaml or F#. We'll assume that you're familiar with its basics. As we\ngo, we'll learn about more advanced ways to use ``match``.\n\nHere are some examples.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Part1.Inductives.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: disc_handrolled\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: disc_handrolled\n\nDiscriminators\n..............\n\nThese functions test whether ``x : three`` matches a given\nconstructor, returning a ``bool`` in each case. Since it's so common\nto write functions that test whether a value of an inductive type\nmatches one of its constructors, F* automatically generates these\nfunctions for you. For example, instead of writing\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Part1.Inductives.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: three_as_int\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: three_as_int\n\nOne can write:\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Part1.Inductives.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: three_as_int'\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: three_as_int'\n\nIn other words, for every constructor ``T`` of an inductive type\n``t``, F* generates a function named ``T?`` (called a \"discriminator\")\nwhich tests if a ``v:t`` matches ``T``.\n\nExhaustiveness\n..............\n\nOf course, an even more direct way of writing ``three_as_int`` is\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Part1.Inductives.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: three_as_int''\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: three_as_int''\n\nEvery time you use a ``match``, F* will make sure to prove that you\nare handling all possible cases. Try omitting one of the cases in\n``three_as_int`` above and see what happens.\n\nExhaustiveness checking in F* is a semantic check and can use the SMT\nsolver to prove that all cases are handled appropriately. For example,\nyou can write this:\n\n.. code-block:: fstar\n\n   let only_two_as_int (x:three { not (Three_of_three? x) })\n     : int\n     = match x with\n       | One_of_three -> 1\n       | Two_of_three -> 2\n\nThe refinement on the argument allows F* to prove that the\n``Three_of_three`` case in the pattern is not required, since that\nbranch would be unreachable anyway.\n\n.. _Part1_tuples:\n\nTuples\n^^^^^^\n\nThe next step from enumerations is to define composite types, e.g.,\ntypes that are made from pairs, triples, quadruples, etc. of other\ntypes. Here's how\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Part1.Ind\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>F*<|>ORGANIZATION<|>F* is a programming language designed to allow its users to define new types, called inductive types or datatypes, and to prove properties about them)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THREE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Three is a new type introduced in F* with three distinct constants: One_of_three, Two_of_three, Three_of_three)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THREE<|>F*<|>Three is a type defined within the F* programming language to demonstrate the concept of inductive types<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

However, it is indicative of a style that one often\nuses to interact with F* when doing SMT-assisted proofs. At each point\nin your program or proof, you can use assert to check what the\nprover “knows” at that point. See what happens if you move the\nassertions around, e.g., if you move assert (sort_ok lo) before\ncalling sort_correct_annotated lo , F* will complain that it is not\nprovable.\n\nYou may be wondering why we used (<=) pivot instead of fun x -> pivot <= x in our code. Arguably, the latter is more readable,\nparticularly to those not already familiar with functional programming\nlanguages. Well, the answer is quite technical.\n\nWe could indeed have written sort like this,\n\nlet rec sort_alt (l:list int)\n  : Tot (list int) (decreases (length l))\n  = match l with\n    | [] -> []\n    | pivot :: tl ->\n      let hi, lo  = partition (fun x -> pivot <= x) tl in\n      append (sort_alt lo) (pivot :: sort_alt hi)\n\n\nAnd we could have tried to write our main lemma this way:\n\nlet sort_alt_ok (l:list int) =\n    let m = sort_alt l in\n    sorted m /\\\n    (forall i. mem i l = mem i m)\n\nlet rec sort_alt_correct_annotated (l:list int)\n  : Lemma (ensures sort_alt_ok l)\n          (decreases (length l))\n  = match l with\n    | [] -> ()\n    | pivot :: tl ->\n      let hi, lo  = partition (fun x -> pivot <= x) tl in\n      assert (length hi + length lo == length tl);\n      sort_alt_correct_annotated hi;\n      assert (sort_alt_ok hi);\n      sort_alt_correct_annotated lo;\n      assert (sort_alt_ok lo);\n      partition_mem (fun x -> pivot <= x) tl;\n      assert (forall i. mem i tl = mem i hi || mem i lo);\n      assert (forall i. mem i hi ==> pivot <= i);\n      assert (forall i. mem i lo ==> i < pivot);\n      //THIS NEXT LINE IS NOT PROVABLE BY SMT ALONE\n      assume (sort_alt l == append (sort_alt lo) (pivot :: sort_alt hi));\n      sorted_concat (sort_alt lo) (sort_alt hi) pivot;\n      assert (sorted (sort_alt l));\n      append_mem (sort_alt lo) (pivot :: sort_alt hi);\n      assert (forall i. mem i l = mem i (sort_alt l))\n\n\nHowever, without further assistance, F*+SMT is unable to prove the\nline at which the assume appears. It turns out, this is due to a\nfundamental limitation in how F* encodes its higher-order logic into\nthe SMT solver’s first-order logic. This encoding comes with some loss\nin precision, particularly for lambda terms. In this case, the SMT\nsolver is unable to prove that the occurrence of fun x -> pivot <= x that appears in the proof of sort_alt_correct_annotated is\nidentical to the occurrence of the same lambda term in sort_alt ,\nand so it cannot conclude that sort_alt l is really equal to append (sort_alt lo) (pivot :: sort_alt hi)) .\n\nThis is unfortunate and can lead to some nasty surprises when trying\nto do proofs about higher order terms. Here are some ways to avoid\nsuch pitfalls:\n\n- Try to use named functions at higher order, rather than lambda\nliterals. Named functions do not suffer a loss in precision when\nencoded to SMT. This is the reason why (<=) pivot worked out\nbetter than the lambda term here—the (<=) is a name that\nsyntactically appears in both the definition of sort and the\nproof of sort_alt_correct and the SMT solver can easily see that\nthe two occurrences are identical.\n\n- If you must use lambda terms, sometimes an intrinsic proof style can\nhelp, as we’ll see below.\n\n- If you must use lambda terms with extrinsic proofs, you can still\ncomplete your proof, but you will have to help F* along with tactics\nor proofs by normalization, more advanced topics that we’ll cover in\nlater sections.\n\n- Even more forward looking, recent higher-order\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SORT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A function that sorts a list of integers, ensuring the output list is sorted and contains the same elements as the input list)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PARTITION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A function that divides a list into two parts based on a predicate, such as elements being less than or equal to a pivot value)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SORT_CORRECT_ANNOTATED<|>PERSON<|>A lemma or proof that ensures the sort function correctly sorts a list of integers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SORT_ALT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An alternative version of the sort function that uses a lambda expression for partitioning)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SORT_ALT_CORRECT_ANNOTATED<|>PERSON<|>A lemma or proof that ensures the alternative sort function correctly sorts a list of integers)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SORT_CORRECT_ANNOTATED<|>SORT<|>SORT_CORRECT_ANNOTATED provides a proof that the sort function behaves as expected<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SORT_ALT_CORRECT_ANNOTATED<|>SORT_ALT<|>SORT_ALT_CORRECT_ANNOTATED provides a proof that the alternative sort function behaves as expected<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PARTITION<|>SORT<|>The sort function uses partition to divide the list into two parts based on the pivot<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PARTITION<|>SORT_ALT<|>The alternative sort function uses partition with a lambda expression to divide the list<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

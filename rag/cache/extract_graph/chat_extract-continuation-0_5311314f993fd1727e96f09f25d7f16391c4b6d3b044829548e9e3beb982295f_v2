Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n \n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n \n3.

We use a ``nat`` to represent\nvariables ``var`` and ``ELam`` represents an annotated lambda term of\nthe form :math:`\\lambda _:t. e`, where the name of the binder is\nomitted, since we're using de Bruijn's representation.\n\nRuntime semantics\n+++++++++++++++++\n\nSTLC has just one main computation rule to execute a program---the\nfunction application rule or a :math:`\\beta` reduction, as shown below:\n\n.. math::\n\n   (\\lambda x:t. e_0)~e_1 \\longrightarrow e_0 [x \\mapsto e_1]\n\nThis says that when a :math:`\\lambda` literal is applied to an\nargument :math:`e_1` the program takes a single step of computation to\nthe body of the lambda literal :math:`e_0` with every occurrence of\nthe bound variable :math:`x` replaced by the argument :math:`e_1`. The\nsubstituion has to be careful to avoid \"name capture\", i.e.,\nsubstituting a term in a context that re-binds its free variables. For\nexample, when substituting :math:`y \\mapsto x` in\n:math:`\\lambda x. y`, one must make sure that the resulting term is\n**not** :math:`\\lambda x. x`. Using de Bruijn notation will help us\nmake precise and avoid name capture.\n\nThe other computation rules in the language are inductively defined,\ne.g., :math:`e_0~e_1` can take a step to :math:`e_0'~e_1` if\n:math:`e_0 \\longrightarrow e_0'`, and similarly for :math:`e_1`.\n\nBy choosing these other rules in different ways one obtains different\nreduction strategies, e.g., call-by-value or call-by-name etc. We'll\nleave the choice of reduction strategy non-deterministic and represent\nthe computation rules of the STLC as an indexed inductive type, ``step\ne e'`` encoding one or more steps of computation.\n\nFormalizing an Operational Semantics\n------------------------------------\n\nThe inductive type ``step`` below describes a single step of\ncomputation in what is known as a \"small-step operational\nsemantics\". The type ``step e e'`` is a relation between an initial\nprogram ``e`` and a program ``e'`` that results after taking one step\nof computation on some sub-term of ``e``.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Part2.STLC.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: step$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: step$\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  * The constructor ``Beta`` represents the rule for :math:`\\beta`\n    reduction. The most subtle part of the development is defining\n    ``subst`` and ``sub_beta``---we'll return to that in detail\n    shortly.\n\n  * ``AppLeft`` and ``AppRight`` allow reducing either the left- or\n    right-subterm of ``EApp e1 e2``.\n\n\nExercise\n^^^^^^^^\n\nDefine an inductive relation ``steps : exp -> exp -> Type`` for the\ntransitive closure of ``step``, representing multiple steps of\ncomputation.\n\nUse this `exercise file <../code/exercises/Part2.STLC.fst>`_ for all\nthe exercises that follow.\n\n.. container:: toggle\n\n    .. container:: header\n\n       **Answer**\n\n    .. literalinclude:: ../code/Part2.STLC.fst\n       :language: fstar\n       :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: steps$\n       :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: steps$\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSubstitution: Failed Attempt\n----------------------------\n\nDefining substitution is the trickiest part of the system. Our first\nattempt will convey the main intuitions, but F* will refuse to accept\nit as well-founded. We'll then enrich our definitions to prove that\nsubstitution terminates.\n\nWe'll define a substitution as a total function from variables ``var``\nto expressions ``exp``.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Part2.STLC.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: sub0$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: sub0$\n\nThese kind of substitutions are sometimes called \"parallel\nsubstitutions\"---the each variable is substituted independently of the\nothers.\n\nWhen doing a :math:`\\beta` reduction, we want to substitute the\nvariable associated with de Bruijn index ``0`` in the body of the\nfunction with the argument ``e`` and then remove the :math:`\\lambda`\nbinder---``sub_beta0`` does just that, replacing variable ``0`` with\n``e`` and shifting other variables down by ``1``, since the\n:math:`\\lambda` binder of the function is removed.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Part2.STLC.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: sub_beta0$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: sub_beta0$\n\nThe function ``subst s e`` applies the substitution ``s`` to ``e``:\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Part2.STLC.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: subst0$\n   :end-before: //SNIPP\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>STLC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>STLC refers to the Simply Typed Lambda Calculus, a formal system for function definition, function application, and recursion)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BETA REDUCTION<|>EVENT<|>Beta reduction is a main computation rule in STLC for executing programs, specifically applying a lambda literal to an argument)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DE BRUIJN NOTATION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A notation system used in STLC to avoid name capture by representing variables without naming them directly)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUBSTITUTION<|>EVENT<|>The process of replacing every occurrence of a bound variable in the body of a lambda literal with an argument)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BETA REDUCTION<|>STLC<|>Beta reduction is a computation rule within the STLC framework<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DE BRUIJN NOTATION<|>STLC<|>De Bruijn notation is utilized in STLC to precisely avoid name capture and simplify variable representation<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SUBSTITUTION<|>BETA REDUCTION<|>Substitution is a crucial part of executing a beta reduction in STLC<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

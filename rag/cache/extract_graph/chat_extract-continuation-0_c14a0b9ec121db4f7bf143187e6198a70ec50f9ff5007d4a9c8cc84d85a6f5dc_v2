However, crucially, the universe levels in ``raise_t`` ensure\nthat the universe levels *increase*, preventing any violation of\nuniverse stratification.\n\nIn fact, this signature is readily implemented in F*, as shown below,\nwhere the universe annotation on ``raise_t`` explicitly defines the\ntype in a higher universe ``u#(max a b)`` rather than in its minimum\nuniverse ``u#a``.\n\n.. code-block:: fstar\n\n  noeq\n  type raise_t (a : Type u#a) : Type u#(max a b) =\n    | Ret : a -> raise_t a\n\n  let raise_val #a x = Ret x\n  let downgrade_val #a x = match x with Ret x0 -> x0\n  let downgrade_val_raise_val #a x = ()\n  let raise_val_downgrade_val #a x = ()\n\n.. _Part2_tips_for_universes:  \n\nTips for working with universes\n-------------------------------\n\nWhenever you write ``Type`` in F*, you are implicitly writing ``Type\nu#?x``, where ``?x`` is a universe *metavariable* left for F* to infer. When\nleft implicit, this means that F* may sometimes infer universes for\nyour definition that are not what you expect---they may be too general\nor not general enough. We conclude this section with a few tips to\ndetect and fix such problems.\n\n* If you see puzzling error messages, enable the following pragma:\n\n  .. code-block:: fstar\n\n     #push-options \"--print_implicits --print_universes\"\n\n  This will cause F* to print larger terms in error messages, which\n  you usually do not want, except when you are confronted with error\n  messages of the form \"expected type t; got type t\".\n\n* Aside from the built-in constants ``Type u#a``, the ``->`` type\n  constructor, and the refinement type former, the only universe\n  polymorphic F* terms are top-level definitions. That is, while you\n  can define ``i`` at the top-level and use it polymorphically:\n\n  .. literalinclude:: ../code/Universes.fst\n     :language: fstar\n     :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: id_top_level$\n     :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: id_top_level$\n\n  You cannot do the same in a non-top-level scope:\n  \n  .. literalinclude:: ../code/Universes.fst\n     :language: fstar\n     :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: no_local_poly$\n     :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: no_local_poly$\n\n  Of course, non-universe-polymorphic definitions work at all scopes,\n  e.g., here, the ``i`` is polymorphic in all types at universe\n  ``u#0``.\n\n  .. literalinclude:: ../code/Universes.fst\n     :language: fstar\n     :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: type_poly$\n     :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: type_poly$\n\n* If you write a ``val f : t`` declaration for ``f``, F* will compute\n  the most general universe for the type ``t`` independently of the\n  ``let f = e`` or ``type f =`` definition.\n\n  A simple example of this behavior is the following. Say, you declare\n  ``tup2`` as below.\n\n  .. literalinclude:: ../code/Universes.fst\n     :language: fstar\n     :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: val tup2$\n     :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: val tup2$\n\n  Seeing this declaration F* infers ``val tup2 (a:Type u#a) (b:Type u#b)\n  : Type u#c``, computing the most general type for ``tup2``.\n\n  If you now try to define ``tup2``, \n\n  .. literalinclude:: ../code/Universes.fst\n     :language: fstar\n     :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: let tup2$\n     :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: let tup2$\n\n  F* complains with the following error (with ``--print_universes`` on):\n\n  .. code-block::\n\n     Type u#(max uu___43588 uu___43589) is not a subtype of the expected type Type u#uu___43590\n     \n  Meaning that the inferred type for the definition of ``tup2 a b`` is\n  ``Type u#(max a b)``, which is of course not the same as ``Type\n  u#c``, and, sadly, the auto-generated fresh names in the error\n  message don't make your life any easier.\n\n  The reason for this is that one can write a ``val f : t`` in a\n  context where a definition for ``f`` may never appear, in which case\n  F* has to compute some universes for ``t``---it chooses the most\n  general universe, though if you do try to implement ``f`` you may\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>RAISE_T<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A type function in F* that increases the universe level of a type from ``u#a`` to ``u#(max a b)``)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RAISE_VAL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A function in F* that wraps a value into the ``raise_t`` type)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DOWNGRADE_VAL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A function in F* that unwraps a value from the ``raise_t`` type, acting as an inverse to ``raise_val``)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>F*<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A programming language designed for program verification that uses universe polymorphism to ensure soundness)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RAISE_VAL<|>RAISE_T<|>``raise_val`` is a function that operates on the ``raise_t`` type<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DOWNGRADE_VAL<|>RAISE_T<|>``downgrade_val`` is a function that operates on the ``raise_t`` type, inversely to ``raise_val``<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DOWNGRADE_VAL<|>RAISE_VAL<|>``downgrade_val`` and ``raise_val`` are mutually inverse functions<|>10)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

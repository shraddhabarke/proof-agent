Its syntax, type system, and runtime behavior can be\ndescribed in just a few lines. The main result we’re interested in\nproving is the soundness of the type system, i.e., that if a program\ntype checks then it can be executed safely without a certain class of\nruntime errors.\n\nIf you haven’t seen the STLC before, there are several good resources\nfor it available on the web, including the Software Foundations book ,\nthough we’ll try to keep the presentation here as self-contained as\npossible. Thanks to Simon Forest, Catalin Hritcu, and Simon Schaffer\nfor contributing parts of this case study.\n\nThe syntax of programs e is defined by the context-free\ngrammar shown below.\n\nThis can be read as follows: a program e is either\n\n- the unit value ( ) ;\n\n- a variable x ;\n\n- a lambda term λ x : t . e 0 associating a variable x to a type t and a some sub-program e 0 ;\n\n- or, the application of the sub-program e 0 to another\nsub-program e 1 .\n\nThe syntax of the type annotation t is also very simple:\n\nA type t is either\n\n- the unit type constant;\n\n- or, arrow type t 0 → t 1 formed from two smaller types t 0 and t 1\n\nThis language is very minimalistic, but it can be easily extended with\nsome other forms, e.g., one could add a type of integers, integer\nconstants, and operators like addition and subtraction. We’ll look at\nthat as part of some exercises.\n\nWe’ll define the syntax of types and programs formally in F* as a pair\nof simple inductive datatypes typ (for types) and exp (for\nprograms or expressions) with a constructor for each of the cases\nabove.\n\nThe main subtlety is in the representation of variables.  For example,\nignoring the type annotations, in the term λ x . ( λ x . x ) the inner lambda binds a different x than the outer one, i.e., the term is equivalent to λ x . ( λ y . y ) and our representation of programs\nmust respect this this convention. We’ll use a technique called de\nBruijn indices, where the names of the variables are no longer\nsignificant and instead each variable is represented by a natural\nnumber describing the number of λ binders that one must\ncross when traversing a term from the occurrence of the variable to\nthat variable’s λ binder.\n\nFor example, the terms λ x . ( λ x . x ) and λ x . ( λ y . y ) are both represented as λ . ( λ . 0 ) , since the inner occurrence of x is associated with the inner λ ; while λ x . ( λ y . ( λ z . x ) ) is represented as λ . ( λ . ( λ . 2 ) , since from the inner\noccurrence of x one must skip past 2 λ ’s\nto reach the λ associated with x . Note, the\nvariable names are no longer significant in de Bruijn’s notation.\n\nThe inductive type typ defined below is our representation of\ntypes.\n\ntype typ =\n  | TUnit : typ\n  | TArr  : typ -> typ -> typ\n\n\nThis is entirely straightforward: a constructor for each case in our\ntype grammar, as described above.\n\nThe representation of program expressions is shown below:\n\nlet var = nat\ntype exp =\n  | EUnit : exp\n  | EVar  : var -> exp\n  | ELam  : typ -> exp -> exp\n  | EApp  : exp -> exp -> exp\n\n\nThis too is straightforward: a constructor for each case in our\nprogram grammar, as described above. We use a nat to represent\nvariables var and ELam represents an annotated lambda term of\nthe form λ : t . e , where the name of the binder is\nomitted, since we’re using de Bruijn’s representation.\n\nSTLC has just one main computation rule to execute a program—the\nfunction application rule or a β reduction, as shown below:\n\nThis says that when a λ literal is applied to an\nargument e 1 the program takes a single step of computation to\nthe body of the lambda literal e 0 with every occurrence of\nthe bound variable x replaced by the argument e 1 . The\nsubstituion has to be careful to avoid “name capture”, i.e.,\nsubstituting a term in a context that re-binds its free variables. For\nexample, when substituting y ↦ x in λ x . y , one must make sure that the resulting term is not λ x . x . Using de Bruijn notation will help us\nmake precise and avoid name capture.\n\nThe other computation rules in the language are inductively defined,\ne.g., e 0 e 1 can take a step to e 0 ′ e 1 if e 0 ⟶ e 0 ′ , and similarly for e 1 .\n\nBy choosing these other rules in different ways one obtains different\nreduction strategies, e.g., call-by-value or call-by-name etc. We’ll\nleave the choice of reduction strategy non-deterministic and represent\nthe computation rules of the STLC as an indexed inductive type, step e e' encoding one or more steps of computation.\n\nThe inductive type\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SIMPLY TYPED LAMBDA CALCULUS (STLC)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A simple programming language often studied in introductory courses on the semantics of programming languages, focusing on syntax, type system, and runtime behavior)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SOFTWARE FOUNDATIONS BOOK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A resource available on the web for studying the Simply Typed Lambda Calculus)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SIMON FOREST<|>PERSON<|>Contributor to the case study on Simply Typed Lambda Calculus)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CATALIN HRITCU<|>PERSON<|>Contributor to the case study on Simply Typed Lambda Calculus)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SIMON SCHAFFER<|>PERSON<|>Contributor to the case study on Simply Typed Lambda Calculus)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DE BRUIJN INDICES<|>EVENT<|>A technique used in the representation of variables within the Simply Typed Lambda Calculus to avoid name significance and capture)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SIMPLY TYPED LAMBDA CALCULUS (STLC)<|>SOFTWARE FOUNDATIONS BOOK<|>The Software Foundations book is a resource for studying the STLC<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SIMON FOREST<|>SIMPLY TYPED LAMBDA CALCULUS (STLC)<|>Simon Forest contributed to the case study on STLC<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CATALIN HRITCU<|>SIMPLY TYPED LAMBDA CALCULUS (STLC)<|>Catalin Hritcu contributed to the case study on STLC<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SIMON SCHAFFER<|>SIMPLY TYPED LAMBDA CALCULUS (STLC)<|>Simon Schaffer contributed to the case study on STLC<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DE BRUIJN INDICES<|>SIMPLY TYPED LAMBDA CALCULUS (STLC)<|>De Bruijn indices are used in STLC to represent variables<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

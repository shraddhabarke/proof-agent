that\nthe two occurrences are identical.\n\n- If you must use lambda terms, sometimes an intrinsic proof style can\nhelp, as we’ll see below.\n\n- If you must use lambda terms with extrinsic proofs, you can still\ncomplete your proof, but you will have to help F* along with tactics\nor proofs by normalization, more advanced topics that we’ll cover in\nlater sections.\n\n- Even more forward looking, recent higher-order variants of SMT\nsolvers are promising and\nmay help address some of these limitations.\n\nAs we observed earlier, our proof of sort_correct had essentially\nthe same structure as the definition of sort itself—it’s tempting\nto fuse the definition of sort with sort_correct , so that we\navoid the duplication and get a proof of correctness of sort built-in to its definition.\n\nSo, here it is, a more compact proof of sort , this time done\nintrinsically, i.e., by enriching the type of sort to capture the\nproperties we want.\n\nlet rec sort_intrinsic (l:list int)\n  : Tot (m:list int {\n                sorted m /\\\n                (forall i. mem i l = mem i m)\n         })\n   (decreases (length l))\n  = match l with\n    | [] -> []\n    | pivot :: tl ->\n      let hi, lo  = partition (fun x -> pivot <= x) tl in\n      partition_mem (fun x -> pivot <= x) tl;\n      sorted_concat (sort_intrinsic lo) (sort_intrinsic hi) pivot;\n      append_mem (sort_intrinsic lo) (pivot :: sort_intrinsic hi);\n      append (sort_intrinsic lo) (pivot :: sort_intrinsic hi)\n\n\nWe still use the same three auxiliary lemmas to prove the properties\nwe want, but this time the recursive calls to sort the partitioned\nsub-lists also serve as calls to the induction hypothesis for the\ncorrectness property we’re after.\n\nNotice also that in this style, the use of a lambda literal isn’t\nproblematic—when operating within the same scope, F*’s encoding to SMT\nis sufficiently smart to treat the multiple occurrences of fun x -> pivot <= x as identical functions.\n\nYou may be concerned that we have just polluted the definition of sort_intrinsic with calls to three additional recursive\nfunctions–will this introduce any runtime overhead when executing sort_intrinsic ? Thankfully, the answer to that is “no”.\n\nAs we’ll learn in the section on effects , F* supports\nof notion of erasure —terms that can be proven to not contribute to\nthe observable behavior of a computation will be erased by the\ncompiler before execution. In this case, the three lemma invocations\nare total functions returning unit, i.e., these are functions that\nalways return in a finite amount of time with the constant value () , with no other observable side effect. So, there is no point in\nkeeping those function calls around—we may as well just optimize them\naway to their result () .\n\nIndeed, if you ask F* to extract the program to OCaml (using fstar --codegen OCaml ), here’s what you get:\n\nlet rec (sort_intrinsic : Prims.int Prims.list -> Prims.int Prims.list) =\n  fun l ->\n    match l with\n    | [] -> []\n    | pivot::tl ->\n       let uu___ = partition (fun x -> pivot <= x) tl in\n       (match uu___ with\n        | (hi, lo) ->\n          append (sort_intrinsic lo) (pivot :: (sort_intrinsic hi)))\n\n\nThe calls to the lemmas have disappeared.\n\nHere’s a file with the scaffolding for this exercise .\n\nThe point of this exercise is to define a generic version of sort that is parameterized by any total order over the list elements,\nrather than specializing sort to work on integer lists only. Of\ncourse, we want to prove our implementations correct. So, let’s do it\nin two ways, both intrinsically and extrinsically. Your goal is to\nremove the all the occurrences of admit in the development below.\n\nmodule Part1.Quicksort.Generic\n\n//Some auxiliary definitions to make this a standalone example\nlet rec length #a (l:list a)\n  : nat\n  = match l with\n    | [] -> 0\n    | _ :: tl -> 1 + length tl\n\nlet rec append #a (l1 l2:list a)\n  : list a\n  = match l1 with\n    | [] -> l2\n    | hd :: tl -> hd :: append tl l2\n\nlet total_order (#a:Type) (f: (a -> a -> bool)) =\n    (forall a. f a a)                                         (* reflexivity   *)\n    /\\ (forall a1 a2.

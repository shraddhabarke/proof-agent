For instance, the program below\nhas return type ``False``:\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Divergence.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: loop_false$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: loop_false$\n\nImportantly, a term of type ``Dv False`` should not be confused as a\n*proof* of ``False``, since that would lead immediately to unsoundness\nof F*'s logical core. In particular, it should be impossible to turn a\n``e:Dv t`` into a term of type ``Tot t``. This is achieved by F*'s\neffect system, which treats ``Tot`` as a sub-effect of ``Dv``, i.e.,\n``Tot < Dv``, in the effect order. As explained in :ref:`earlier\n<Part4_Background>`, this ensures that no ``Tot`` term can depend on a\n``Dv`` term, maintaining soundness of the total correctness\ninterpretation of ``Tot``.\n\nAs an example, the following attempt to \"cast\" ``dv_false`` to ``Tot``\nfails, as does trying to use ``dv_false`` to produce incorrect proofs\nof other types.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Divergence.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: loop_false_failures$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: loop_false_failures$\n\n\nWhile F* does not allow ``Tot`` computations to depend on ``Dv``\ncomputations, going the other way is perfectly fine. Intuitively,\nalways terminating computations are potentially non-terminating. We\ncan think of it like a *weakening* of the specification:\n\n.. code-block:: fstar\n                \n   let add_one (x:int) : int = x + 1\n   let add_one_div (x:int) : Dv int = add_one x\n\nThe effect system of F* automatically *lifts* ``Tot`` computations\ninto ``Dv``, meaning that ``Tot`` functions can be seamlessly used in\n``Dv`` functions.\n\nThe weakening of ``Tot`` terms to other effects is so pervasive in F*\nthat one hardly even thinks about it, e.g., in the ``collatz``\nprogram, sub-terms like ``n / 2`` are in ``Tot`` but are easily used\nwithin a computation in the ``Dv`` effect.\n   \nNo extrinsic proofs for ``Dv`` computations\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nOne important consequence of any effectful code, including ``Dv``,\nbeing outside the logical core of F* is that it is not possible to do\n:ref:`extrinsic proofs <Part1_intrinsic_extrinsic>` about effectful\ncode. One cannot even state properties of ``Dv`` computations in\nspecifications, since even specifications must be total. For example,\neven stating the following lemma is illegal:\n\n.. code-block:: fstar\n\n   [@@expect_failure]\n   val collatz_property (n:pos)\n     : Lemma (Cons? (collatz n) /\\ last (collatz n) = 1)\n\nThis is nonsensical in F* since writing ``Cons? (collatz n)`` supposes\nthat ``collatz n`` is *defined*, whereas it might actually just loop\nforever.\n\nThe only way to state properties about divergent programs is to encode\nthe property intrinsically in the computation type, as we saw above.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Divergence.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: val collatz_ends_in_one$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: val collatz_ends_in_one$\n\nExercise\n++++++++\n\nDefine a predicate ``collatz_spec (n:pos) (l:list pos) : bool`` that\ndecides if ``l`` is a valid Collatz sequence starting at ``n``.\n\nImplement ``val collatz' (n:pos) : Dv (l:list pos { collatz_spec n l })``.\n\nWhat does this type mean? Are there other ways to implement\n``collatz'`` with the same type?\n\n\n.. container:: toggle\n\n    .. container:: header\n\n       **Answer**\n\n    .. literalinclude:: ../code/Divergence.fst\n       :language: fstar\n       :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: collatz_spec$\n       :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: collatz_spec$\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGeneral Recursive Types and Impredicativity with ``Dv``\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nAside from disabling the decreases metric on recursive functions in\n``Dv``, F* also disables two other forms of termination checking on\n``\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>COLLATZ FUNCTION<|>EVENT<|>A mathematical function explored within the context of termination properties and sequences ending in \"1\">)##\n(\"entity\"<|>F*<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A programming language and proof assistant for program verification that employs an effect system to distinguish between total (Tot) and divergent (Dv) computations>)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COLLATZ FUNCTION<|>F*<|>The Collatz function's properties, such as termination and sequence behavior, are analyzed and verified using F*'s programming and effect system<|>8)<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

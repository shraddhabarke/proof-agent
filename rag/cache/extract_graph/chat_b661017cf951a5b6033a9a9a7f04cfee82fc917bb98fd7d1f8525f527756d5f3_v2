Automating proofs\nthat require quantifier instantiation is a large topic in its own\nright, as we’ll cover in a later section—this wiki page provides some hints.\n\nOften, eliminating a universal quantifier is automated by the SMT\nsolver, as shown below, where the SMT solver easily instantiates the\nquantified hypothesis f with a .\n\nlet forall_elim_1 (#t:Type)\n                  (#q:t -> Type)\n                  (f : squash (forall (x:t). q x))\n                  (a:t)\n  : squash (q a)\n  = ()\n\n\nBut, F* also provides syntactic sugar to explicitly trigger quantifier\ninsantiation (as shown below), where the terms provided on the with line are instantiations for each of the binders on the eliminate line.\n\nlet forall_elim_2 (#t0:Type)\n                  (#t1:t0 -> Type)\n                  (#q: (x0:t0 -> x1:t1 x0 -> Type))\n                  (f : squash (forall x0 x1. q x0 x1))\n                  (v0: t0)\n                  (v1: t1 v0)\n  : squash (q v0 v1)\n  = eliminate forall x0 x1. q x0 x1\n    with v0 v1\n\n\nIts desugaring may be illuminating:\n\n   FStar.Classical.Sugar.forall_elim\n           #(t1 v0)\n           #(fun x1 -> q v0 x1)\n           v1\n           (FStar.Classical.Sugar.forall_elim\n              #t0\n              #(fun x0 -> forall (x1: t1 x0). q x0 x1)\n              v0\n              ())\n\n\nFinally, we come to existential quantification.

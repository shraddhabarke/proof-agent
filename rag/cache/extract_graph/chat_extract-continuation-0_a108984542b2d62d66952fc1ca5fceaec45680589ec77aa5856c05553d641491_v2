A type system in this style is sometimes\ncalled a *Pure Type System* or `PTS\n<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_type_system>`_.\n\nIn F* (as in other PTSs) types have types too, functions can take\ntypes as arguments and return types as results, etc. In particular,\nthe type of a type is ``Type``, e.g., ``bool : Type``, ``int : Type``,\n``int -> int : Type`` etc. In fact, even ``Type`` has a type---as\nwe'll see when we learn about *universes*.\n\nParametric polymorphism or generics\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nMost modern typed languages provide a way to write programs with\ngeneric types. For instance, C# and Java provide generics, C++ has\ntemplates, and languages like OCaml and Haskell have several kinds of\npolymorphic types.\n\nIn F*, writing functions that are generic or polymorphic in types\narises naturally as a special case of the :ref:`arrow types\n<Part1_ch1_arrows>` that we have already learned about. For example,\nhere's a polymorphic identity function::\n\n  let id : a:Type -> a -> a = fun a x -> x\n\nThere are a several things to note here:\n\n* The type of ``id`` is an arrow type, with two arguments. The first\n  argument is ``a : Type``; the second argument is a term of type\n  ``a``; and the result also has the same type ``a``.\n\n* The definition of ``id`` is a lambda term with two arguments ``a :\n  Type`` (corresponding to the first argument type) and ``x : a``. The\n  function returns ``x``---it's an identity function on the second\n  argument.\n\nJust as with any function, you can write it instead like this:\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Part1.Poly.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: id\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: id\n\nTo call ``id``, one can apply it first to a type and then to a value of that type, as shown below.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Part1.Poly.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: id applications\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: id applications\n\nWe've defined a function that can be applied to a value ``x:a`` for\nany type ``a``. The last line there maybe requires a second read: we\ninstantiated ``id`` to ``int -> int`` and then applied it to ``id``\ninstantiated to ``int``.\n\nExercises\n^^^^^^^^^\n\nLet's try a few simple exercises. `Click here\n<../code/exercises/Part1.Poly.fst>`_ for the exercise file.\n\n\nTry defining functions with the following signatures:\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Part1.Poly.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: sig apply_and_compose\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: sig apply_and_compose\n\n.. container:: toggle\n\n    .. container:: header\n\n       **Answer**\n\n    .. literalinclude:: ../code/Part1.Poly.fst\n       :language: fstar\n       :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: apply_and_compose\n       :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: apply_and_compose\n\nHow about writing down a signature for ``twice``:\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Part1.Poly.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: def twice\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: def twice\n\n.. container:: toggle\n\n    .. container:: header\n\n       **Answer**\n\n    .. literalinclude:: ../code/Part1.Poly.fst\n       :language: fstar\n       :start-after: SNIPPET_START: sig twice\n       :end-before: SNIPPET_END: sig twice\n\nIt's quite tedious to have to explicitly provide that first type\nargument to ``id``. Implicit arguments and type inference will help,\nas we'll see, next.\n\n\nType inference: Basics\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n.. _inference:\n\nLike many other languages in the tradition of\n`Milner's ML <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ML_%28programming_language%29>`_,\ntype inference is a central component in F*'s design.\n\nYou may be used to type inference in other languages, where one can\nleave out type annotations (e.g., on variables, or when using\ntype-polymorphic (aka generic) functions) and the compiler determines\nan appropriate type based on the surrounding program context. F*'s\ntype inference includes such a feature, but is considerably more\npowerful. Like in other dependently typed language, F*'s inference\nengine is based on `higher-order unification\n<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unification_(computer_science)#Higher-order_unification>`_\nand can be used to infer arbitrary fragments of program text\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>F*<|>ORGANIZATION<|>F* is a dependently typed language that treats programs and their types uniformly, featuring a Pure Type System (PTS) and supporting parametric polymorphism or generics)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PURE TYPE SYSTEM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A type system where types have types, and functions can take types as arguments and return types as results)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>C#<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A modern typed language that provides generics)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JAVA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A modern typed language that provides generics)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>C++<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A modern typed language that has templates)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OCAML<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A modern typed language that has several kinds of polymorphic types)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HASKELL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A modern typed language that has several kinds of polymorphic types)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ML<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A programming language tradition known for its type inference capabilities)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>F*<|>PURE TYPE SYSTEM<|>F* operates within the framework of a Pure Type System (PTS)<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>F*<|>C#<|>F* shares the concept of generics with C#, among other modern typed languages<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>F*<|>JAVA<|>F* shares the concept of generics with Java, among other modern typed languages<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>F*<|>C++<|>F* shares the concept of parametric polymorphism with C++, which uses templates<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>F*<|>OCAML<|>F* and OCaml both support several kinds of polymorphic types<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>F*<|>HASKELL<|>F* and Haskell both support several kinds of polymorphic types<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>F*<|>ML<|>F*'s design and type inference capabilities are in the tradition of Milner's ML<|>4)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

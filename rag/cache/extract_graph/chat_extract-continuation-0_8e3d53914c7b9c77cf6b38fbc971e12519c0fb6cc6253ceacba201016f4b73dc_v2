That’s because when using a hint, each query to Z3\nspawns a new Z3 process initialized with just the facts in the\nunsat core, and that incurs some basic start-up time costs.\n\nfstar.exe --use_hints ContextPollution.fst\n\n\nMany F* projects use hints as part of their build, including F*’s\nstandard library. The .hints files are checked in to the repository\nand are periodically refreshed as proofs evolve. This helps improve\nthe stability of proofs: it may take a while for a proof to go\nthrough, but once it does, you can record and replay the unsat core\nand subsequent attempts of the same proof (or even small variations of\nit) can go through quickly.\n\nOther projects do not use hints: some people (perhaps rightfully) see\nhints as a way of masking underlying proof performance problems and\nprefer to make proofs work quickly and robustly without hints. If you\ncan get your project to this state, without relying on hints, then so\nmuch the better for you!\n\nIf you have a proof that takes very long without hints but goes\nthrough quickly with hints, then the hints might help you diagnose why\nthe original proof was taking so long. This wiki page describes how to compare two Z3 quantifier instantiation profiles with a tool that comes with Z3 called qprofdiff.\n\nSometimes, Z3 will report an unsat core, but when F* uses it to try to\nreplay a proof, Z3 will be unable to find a proof of unsat, and F*\nwill fall back to trying the proof again in its original context. The\nfailure to find a proof of unsat from a previously reported unsat core\nis not a Z3 unsoundness or bug—it’s because although the report core\nis really logically unsat, finding a proof of unsat may have relied on\nquantifier instantiation hints from facts that are not otherwise\nsemantically relevant. The following example illustrates.\n\nmodule HintReplay\n\nassume\nval p (x:int) : prop\n\nassume\nval q (x:int) : prop\n\nassume\nval r (x:int) : prop\n\nassume P_Q : forall (x:int). {:pattern q x} q x ==> p x\nassume Q_R : forall (x:int). {:pattern p x} q x ==> r x\n\nlet test (x:int { q x }) = assert (r x)\n\n\nSay you run the following:\n\nfstar --record_hints HintReplay.fst\nfstar --query_stats --use_hints HintReplay.fst\n\n\nYou will see the following output from the second run:\n\n(HintReplay.fst(15,27-15,39))   Query-stats (HintReplay.test, 1)        failed\n  {reason-unknown=unknown because (incomplete quantifiers)} (with hint)\n  in 42 milliseconds ..\n\n(HintReplay.fst(15,27-15,39))   Query-stats (HintReplay.test, 1)        succeeded\n  in 740 milliseconds ...\n\n\nThe first attempt at the query failed when using the hint, and the\nsecond attempt at the query (without the hint) succeeded.\n\nTo see why, notice that to prove the assertion r x from the\nhypothesis q x , logically, the assumption Q_R suffices. Indeed, if you look in the hints file, you will see that it\nonly mentions HintReplay.Q_R as part of the logical core. However, Q_R is guarded by a pattern p x and in the absence of the\nassumption P_Q , there is no way for the solver to derive an active\nterm p x to instantiate Q_R —so, with just the unsat core, it\nfails to complete the proof.\n\nFailures for hint replay usually point to some unusual quantifier\ntriggering pattern in your proof. For instance, here we used p x as a pattern, even though p x doesn’t appear anywhere in Q_R —that’s not usually a good choice, though sometimes, e.g.,\nwhen using artificial triggers it can\ncome up.\n\nThis wiki page on hints provides more information about diagnosing hint-replay failures,\nparticularly in the context of the Low* libraries.\n\n© Copyright 2020, Microsoft Research.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>FSTAR.EXE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A tool used for verifying properties of F* programs, capable of utilizing hints to improve verification times>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CONTEXT POLLUTION.FST<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An F* module that demonstrates the use of hints in verification processes>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Z3<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A theorem prover used by F* for solving queries and assisting in the verification of proofs>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HINTREPLAY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An F* module illustrating the behavior of hint replay and its impact on proof verification>)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FSTAR.EXE<|>CONTEXT POLLUTION.FST<|>Fstar.exe is used to verify the ContextPollution.fst module with the help of hints<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FSTAR.EXE<|>Z3<|>Fstar.exe utilizes Z3 for query solving during the verification process<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CONTEXT POLLUTION.FST<|>Z3<|>The verification of ContextPollution.fst relies on Z3 to process queries and hints<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HINTREPLAY<|>Z3<|>HintReplay module's verification process involves analyzing Z3's behavior with and without hints<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

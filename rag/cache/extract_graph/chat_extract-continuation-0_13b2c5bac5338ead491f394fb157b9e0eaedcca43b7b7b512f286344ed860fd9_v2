To structure our\ninterpreter, we’ll introduce a simple state monad st a . We’ve seen\nthis construction before in a previous chapter —so, look there if the state monad is unfamiliar\nto you. Recall that F* has support for monadic let operators: the let! provides syntactic sugar to convenient compose st terms.\n\nlet st (a:Type) = state -> (a & state)\n\nlet get : st state = fun s -> (s, s)\n\nlet put (s:state) : st unit = fun _ -> ((), s)\n\nlet (let!) #a #b (f:st a) (g: a -> st b) : st b = \n  fun s -> let v, s' = f s in g v s'\n\nlet return #a (x:a) : st a = fun s -> (x, s)\n\n\nNow, the interpreter itself is a total, recursive function run which\ninterprets a program p as a state-passing function of type st unit , or state -> unit & state .\n\nlet rec run (p:program)\n  : Tot (st unit)\n        (decreases %[p;0])\n  = match p with\n    | Assign x e -> \n      let! s = get in\n      let v = eval_expr e s in\n      put (write s x v)\n\n    | Seq p1 p2 -> \n      run p1;!\n      run p2\n\n    | If e p1 p2 ->\n      let! s = get in\n      let n = eval_expr e s in\n      if n <> 0 then run p1 else run p2\n      \n    | Repeat e p ->\n      let! s = get in\n      let n = eval_expr e s in\n      if n <= 0 then return ()\n      else run_repeat p n\n\nand run_repeat (p:program) (n:nat)\n  : Tot (st unit)\n        (decreases %[p; 1; n])\n  = if n = 0 then return ()\n    else ( run p ;! run_repeat p (n - 1) )\n\n\nLet’s look at its definition in detail:\n\n- Assign x e : Evaluate e in the current state and then\nupdate the state with a new value of x .\n\n- Seq p1 p2 : Simply run p1 and then run p2 , where ;! is syntactic sugar for let! _ = run p1 in run p2 .\n\n- If e p1 p2 : Evaluate e in the current state, branch on\nits result and run either p1 or p2\n\n- Repeat e p : Evaluate e to n , and if n is\ngreater than zero, call the mutually recursive run_repeat n p . Most of the subtlety here is in convincing F* that this\nmutually recursive function terminates, but this is fairly\nstraightforward once you know how—we discussed termination proofs for mutually recursive functions earlier .\n\nThese operational semantics are the ground truth for our programming\nlanguage—it defines how programs execute. Now that we have that\nsettled, we can look at how a Floyd-Hoare logic makes it possible to\nreason about programs in a structured way.\n\nThe goal of a Floyd-Hoare logic is to provide a way to reason about a\nprogram based on the structure of its syntax, rather than reasoning\ndirectly about its operational semantics. The unit of reasoning is\ncalled a Hoare triple , a predicate of the form {P} c {Q} , where P and Q are predicates about the state of the program, and c is the program itself.\n\nWe can define Hoare triples for our language by interpreting them as\nan assertion about the operational semantics, where triple p c q represents, formally, the Hoare triple { p } c { q } .\n\nlet triple (pre:state -> prop)\n           (c:program)\n           (post:state -> prop)\n  = forall s0. pre s0 ==> post (snd (run c s0))\n\n\nThe predicate triple p c q is valid, if when executing c in a\nstate that satisfies p results in a state that satisfies q .\nThe predicates p and q are also called precondition and\npostcondition of c , respectively.\n\nFor each syntactic construct of our language, we can prove a lemma\nthat shows how to build an instance of the triple predicate for\nthat construct. Then, to build a proof of program, one stitches\ntogether these lemmas to obtain a triple p main q , a statement of\ncorrectess of the main program.\n\nOur first rule is for reasoning about variable assignment:\n\nlet assignment (x:var) (e:expr) (post:state -> prop)\n  : Lemma (triple (fun s0 -> post\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>STATE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A model used to represent the memory of a program, mapping global variables to integers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EVAL_EXPR<|>EVENT<|>A function to evaluate expressions within a given state)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ST<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A simple state monad used to structure the interpreter, facilitating state-passing functions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RUN<|>EVENT<|>A total, recursive function that interprets a program as a state-passing function)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ASSIGN<|>EVENT<|>An operation to evaluate an expression in the current state and update the state with a new value)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SEQ<|>EVENT<|>An operation to run two programs sequentially)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IF<|>EVENT<|>An operation to evaluate an expression and run one of two programs based on the result)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REPEAT<|>EVENT<|>An operation to evaluate an expression to n and, if greater than zero, recursively run a program n times)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FLOYD-HOARE LOGIC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A logic system to reason about programs based on their syntax rather than their operational semantics)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HOARE TRIPLE<|>EVENT<|>A predicate form {P} c {Q} used in Floyd-Hoare logic to reason about the state of a program before and after execution)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EVAL_EXPR<|>STATE<|>EVAL_EXPR function operates within a given state to evaluate expressions<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ST<|>STATE<|>ST monad is a construct that operates over the state for passing functions<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RUN<|>ST<|>RUN function utilizes the ST monad to interpret programs as state-passing functions<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ASSIGN<|>STATE<|>ASSIGN operation updates the state with a new value for a variable<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SEQ<|>RUN<|>SEQ operation is defined within the context of the RUN function to execute programs sequentially<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>IF<|>RUN<|>IF operation is part of the RUN function, deciding program execution paths based on state evaluation<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>REPEAT<|>RUN<|>REPEAT operation is managed by the RUN function to execute a program multiple times based on state evaluation<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HOARE TRIPLE<|>FLOYD-HOARE LOGIC<|>HOARE TRIPLE is a fundamental concept within Floyd-Hoare logic for reasoning about program states<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

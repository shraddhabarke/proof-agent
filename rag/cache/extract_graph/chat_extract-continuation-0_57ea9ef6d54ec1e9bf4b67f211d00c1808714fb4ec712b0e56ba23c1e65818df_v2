However, since\ncomputations in the ``Dv`` effect are already allowed to loop forever,\nthe strict positivity condition can be relaxed when ``Dv`` types are\ninvolved. For example, one can define this:\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Divergence.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: nonpos$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: nonpos$\n\nThe type ``nonpos`` is not strictly positive, since it appears to the\nleft of an arrow in a field of one of its constructors. Indeed, usingn\n``nonpos`` it is possible to define (without using ``let rec``) an\ninfinitely looping program ``loop_nonpos()``---however, the type ``Dv\nFalse`` tells us that this program may loop forever, and the infinite\nloop is safely isolated from F*'s logical core.\n\nThe other place in F*'s type system where termination checking comes\ninto play is in the :ref:`universe levels <Part2_universes>`. As we\nlearned previously, the logical core of F* is organized into an\ninfinite hierarchy with copies of the F* type system arranged in a\ntower of universes. This stratification is necessary to prevent\ninconsistencies within the logical core. However, terms in the ``Dv``\neffect are outside the logical core and, as such, restrictions on the\nuniverse levels no longer apply. As the snippet below shows a total\nfunction returning a type in universe ``u#a`` resides in universe\n``u#(a + 1)``. However, a ``Dv`` function returning a type in ``u#a``\nis just in universe ``0``, since the only way to obtain the type\n``dv_type`` returns is by incurring a ``Dv`` effect and moving outside\nF*'s logical core.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Divergence.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: universe_dv$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: universe_dv$\n\nTop-level Effects\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nA top-level F* term is not meant to be effectful. If one defines the\nfollowing term, F* accepts the term but raises a warning saying\n\"Top-level let bindings must be total---this term may have effects\".\n\n.. code-block:: fstar\n\n   let inconsistent : False = loop_nonpos()                \n\nTop-level effects can be problematic for a few reasons:\n\n  1. The order of evaluation of the effects in top-level terms is\n     undefined for programs with multiple modules---it depends on the\n     order in which modules are loaded at runtime.\n\n  2. Top-level effects, particularly when divergence is involved, can\n     render F*'s typechecking context inconsistent. For example, once\n     ``inconsistent`` is defined, then any other assertion can be\n     proven.\n\n     .. code-block :: fstar\n\n         let _  = let _ = FStar.Squash.return_squash inconsistent in\n                  assert false\n\nNevertheless, when used carefully, top-level effects can be useful,\ne.g., to initialize the state of a module, or to start the main\nfunction of a program. So, pay attention to the warning F* raises when\nyou have a top-level effect and make sure you really know what you're\ndoing.\n\nExample: Untyped Lambda Calculus\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nIn this section, we put together the various things we've learned\nabout ``Dv`` computations to define several variants of an untyped\nlambda calculus.\n\nYou can refer back to our prior development of the :ref:`simply typed\nlambda calculus <Part2_stlc>` if you need some basic background on the\nlambda calculus.\n\nInterpreting Deeply Embedded Lambda Terms\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nWe start by defining the syntax of untyped lambda terms, below.  The\nvariables use the de Bruijn convention, where a index of a variable\ncounts the number of lambda-binders to traverse to reach its binding\noccurrence. The ``Lam`` case just has the body of the lambda term,\nwith no type annotation on the binder, and no explicit name for the\nvariable.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Divergence.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: deep_embedding_syntax$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: deep_embedding_syntax$\n\nAs usual, we can define what it means to substitute a variable ``x``\nwith a (closed) term ``v`` in ``t``---this is just a regular ``Tot``\nfunction.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Divergence.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: deep_embedding_subst$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: deep_embedding_subst$\n\nFinally,\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>DV<|>ORGANIZATION<|>DV refers to a computational effect in F* that allows for non-terminating computations and loops)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>F*<|>ORGANIZATION<|>F* is a programming language designed for program verification, supporting effects like DV for non-terminating computations)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NONPOS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A type in F* that is not strictly positive, allowing for the definition of infinitely looping programs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FALSE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>In the context of F*, False is a type used to indicate logical falsehood or inconsistency)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DV<|>F*<|>DV is an effect in F* that disables certain forms of termination checking, allowing for infinite loops<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NONPOS<|>DV<|>NONPOS is a type example in F* that utilizes the DV effect to enable potentially infinite computations<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FALSE<|>F*<|>FALSE is a type in F* used to denote logical falsehood, which can be used to demonstrate inconsistencies when combined with top-level effects like DV<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

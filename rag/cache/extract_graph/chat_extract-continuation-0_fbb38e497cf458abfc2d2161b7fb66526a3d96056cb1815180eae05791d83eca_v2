Now, these are the\nonly two lemmas we have to reason about the hoare p c q predicate.\n\nNext, we define some notation to make it a bit more convenient to\nwrite programs in our small language.\n\nlet ( := ) (x:var) (y:expr) = Assign x y\n\nlet add (e1 e2:expr) = EAdd e1 e2\n\nlet c (i:int) : expr = EConst i\n\nlet v (x:var) : expr = EVar x\n\nlet rec prog (p:list program { Cons? p }) \n  : program \n  = match p with\n    | [c] -> c\n    | c::cs -> Seq c (prog cs)\n\nlet x = 0\nlet y = 1\nlet z = 2\n\n\nFinally, we can build proofs of some simple, loop-free programs\nautomatically by computing their wp using wp_hoare and\napplying hoare_consequence to get F* and Z3 to prove that the\ninferred WP is implied by the annotated precondition.\n\nlet swap = prog [ z := v x; x := v y; y := v z]\nlet proof_swap (lx ly:int)\n  : squash (hoare (fun s -> read s x = lx /\\ read s y = ly) swap\n                  (fun s -> read s x = ly /\\ read s y = lx))\n  = hoare_consequence _ (wp_hoare swap _) ()\n\n\nThis recipe of computing verification conditions using WPs and then\nchecking the computed WP against the annotated specification using a\nsolver like Z3 is a very common and powerful pattern. In fact, as\nwe’ll see below, the methodology that we’ve developed here for our\nsmall imperative language is exactly what the F* typechecker does (at\na larger scale and for the whole F* language) when checking an F*\nprogram.\n\nF* provides a weakest precondition calculus for reasoning about pure\ncomputations. The calculus is based on a Dijkstra Monad , a\nconstruction first introduced in this paper . In\nthis chapter, we will learn about Dijkstra Monad and its usage in\nspecifying and proving pure programs in F*.\n\nThe first main difference in adapting the Hoare triples and weakest\nprecondition computations that we saw earlier to the setting of F*’s\nfunctional language is that there are no global variables or mutable\nstate (we’ll see about how model mutable state in F*’s effect system\nlater). Instead, each pure expression in F*’s returns a value and\nthe postconditions that we will manipulate are predicates about these\nvalues, rather than state predicates.\n\nTo illustrate, we sketch the definition of pure WPs below.\n\nWP c Q                      = Q c\nWP (let x = e1 in e2) Q     = WP e1 (fun x -> WP e2 Q)\nWP (if e then e1 else e2) Q = (e ==> WP e1 Q) /\\ (~e ==> WP e2 Q)\n\n\n- The WP of a constant c is just the postcondition Q applied to c .\n\n- The WP of a let binding is a sequential composition of WPs,\napplied to the values returned by each sub-expression\n\n- The WP of a condition is the WP of each branch, weakened by the\nsuitable branch condition, as before.\n\nThe F* type system internalizes and generalizes this WP construction\nto apply it to all F* terms. The form this takes is as a computation\ntype in F*, PURE a wp , where in prims.fst , PURE is defined\nas an F* primitive effect with a signature as shown below–we’ll see\nmuch more of the new_effect syntax as we look at user-defined\neffects in subsequent chapters; for now, just see it as a reserved\nsyntax in F* to introduce a computation type constructor.\n\nnew_effect PURE (a:Type) (w:wp a) { ... }\n\n\nwhere\n\nlet pre = Type0\nlet post (a:Type) = a -> Type0\nlet wp (a:Type) = post a -> pre\n\n\nA program e of type PURE a wp is a computation which\n\n- Is defined only when wp (fun _ -> True) is valid\n\n- If wp post is valid, then e terminates without any side\neffects and returns a value v:a satisfying post v .\n\nNotice that wp a is the type of a function transforming\npostconditions ( a -> Type0 ) to preconditions ( Type0 ). [ 1 ] The wp argument is also called an index of the PURE effect. [ 2 ]\n\nThe return operator for wp a is shown below: it is analogous to\nthe WP c Q and WP x\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>HOARE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Hoare is a concept used in computer science for reasoning about the correctness of computer programs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WP_HOARE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A function that computes the weakest precondition for a given program and postcondition)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HOARE_CONSEQUENCE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A lemma that applies the hoare logic to prove the correctness of a program given a precondition and a postcondition)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>F*<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A programming language designed for program verification that uses a weakest precondition calculus for reasoning about pure computations)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Z3<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A theorem prover from Microsoft Research used for checking the validity of logical formulas)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DIJKSTRA MONAD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A construction used in F* for specifying and proving pure programs)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WP_HOARE<|>HOARE<|>WP_Hoare computes the weakest precondition using the principles of Hoare logic<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HOARE_CONSEQUENCE<|>HOARE<|>Hoare_consequence applies Hoare logic to prove program correctness<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>F*<|>DIJKSTRA MONAD<|>F* uses the Dijkstra Monad for reasoning about pure computations<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>F*<|>Z3<|>F* integrates with Z3 to check the validity of verification conditions<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

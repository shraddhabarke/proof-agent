All those modules are encoded to the SMT solver producing\nabout 11MB of SMT2 definitions with nearly 20,000 assertions for the\nsolver to process. This makes for a large search space for the solver\nto explore to find a proof, however, most of those assertions are\nquantified formulas guarded by patterns and they remain inert unless\nsome active term triggers them. Nevertheless, all these definitions\nimpose a noticeable overhead to the solver. If you turn --query_stats on (after a single warm-up query), it takes Z3 about\n300 milliseconds (and about 3000 quantifier instantiations) to find a\nproof for test1 .\n\nYou probably won’t really notice the overhead of a proof that takes\n300 milliseconds—the F* standard library doesn’t have many\nquantifiers in scope with things like bad quantifier alternation that\nlead to matching loops. However, as your development starts to depend\non an ever larger stack of modules, there’s the danger that at some\npoint, your proofs are impacted by some bad choice of quantifiers in\nsome module that you have forgotten about. In that case, you may find\nthat seemingly simple proofs take many seconds to go through.

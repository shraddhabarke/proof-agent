In the code above, the then -branch is typechecked in a context including a hypothesis h_then: squash (equals (x > 0) true) , while the else branch\nincludes the hypothesis h_else: squash (equals (x > 0) false) . The\npresence of these additional control-flow hypotheses, in conjunction\nwith whatever else is in the context (in particular hypothesis h )\nallows us to derive (a == int) and (b == int) in the\nrespective branches and convert the types of aa and bb accordingly.\n\nImplicit conversions with provable equalities are very convenient—we\nhave relied on it without noticing in nearly all our examples so far,\nstarting from the simplest examples about lists to vectors and Merkle\ntrees, and some might say this is the one key feature which gives F*\nits programming-oriented flavor.\n\nHowever, as the previous example hinted, it is, in general,\nundecidable to determine if a == b is derivable in a given\ncontext. In practice, however, through the use of an SMT solver, F*\ncan often figure out when terms are provably equal and convert using\nit. But, it cannot always do this. In such cases, the F* standard\nlibrary offers the following primitive (in FStar.Pervasives), which\nallows the user to write coerce_eq pf x , to explicitly coerce the\ntype of x using the equality proof pf .\n\nlet coerce_eq (#a #b:Type) (_:squash (a == b)) (x:a) : b = x\n\n\nAnother consequence of equality reflection is the loss of strong\nnormalization. Intensional type theories enjoy a nice property\nensuring that every term will reduce to a canonical normal form, no\nmatter the order of evaluation. F* does not have this property, since\nsome terms, under certain evaluation orders, can reduce\ninfinitely. However, metatheory developed for F* proves that closed\nterms (terms without free variables) in the Tot effect do not\nreduce infinitely, and as a corollary, there are no closed proofs of False .\n\nF* includes various heuristics to avoid getting stuck in an infinite\nloop when reducing open terms, but one can craft examples to make F*’s\nreduction macinery loop forever. As such, deciding if possibly open\nterms have the same normal form is also undecidable in F*.\n\nFunctional extensionality is a principle that asserts the provable\nequality of functions that are pointwise equal. That is, for functions f and g , ∀ x . f x == g x implies f == g .\n\nThis principle is provable as a theorem in F*, but only for function\nliterals, or, equivalently, η -expanded functions. That is,\nthe following is a theorem in F*.\n\nlet eta (#a:Type) (#b: a -> Type) (f: (x:a -> b x)) = fun x -> f x\nlet funext_on_eta (#a : Type) (#b: a -> Type) (f g : (x:a -> b x))\n                  (hyp : (x:a -> Lemma (f x == g x)))\n  : squash (eta f == eta g)\n  = _ by (norm [delta_only [`%eta]];\n          pointwise (fun _ ->\n             try_with\n                     (fun _ -> mapply (quote hyp))\n                     (fun _ -> trefl()));\n           trefl())\n\n\nNote\n\nNote, the proof of the theorem makes use of tactics, a topic we’ll\ncover in a later chapter. You do not need to understand it in\ndetail, yet. The proof roughly says to descend into every sub-term\nof the goal and try to rewrite it using the pointwise equality\nhypothesis hyp , and if it fails to just rewrite the sub-term to\nitself.\n\nUnfortunately, functional extensionality does not apply to all\nfunctions. That is, the following is not provable in F* nor is it\nsound to assume it as an axiom.\n\nlet funext =\n  #a:Type ->\n  #b:(a -> Type) ->\n  f:(x:a -> b x) ->\n  g:(x:a -> b x) ->\n  Lemma (requires (forall (x:a). f x == g x))\n        (ensures f == g)\n\n\nThe problem is illustrated by the following counterexample, which\nallows deriving False in a context where funext is valid.\n\nlet f (x:nat) : int = 0\nlet g (x:nat) : int = if x = 0 then 1 else 0\nlet pos = x:nat{x > 0}\nlet full_funext_false (ax:funext)\n  : False\n  = ax #pos f g;\n    assert (f == g);\n    assert (f 0 == g 0);\n    false_elim()\n\n\nThe proof works by exploiting the interaction with refinement\nsubtyping. f and g are clearly not pointwise equal on the\nentire domain of natural numbers, yet they are pointwise equal on the\npositive natural numbers. However, from ax #pos f g we gain that f == g , and in particular that f 0 == g 0 , which is false.\n\nNote\n\nThe trouble arises in part because although ax:funext proves squash (equals #(pos -> int) f g) , F*’s encoding of the\nequality to the SMT solver (whose equality is untyped) treats the\nequality as squash (equals #(nat -> int) f g) , which leads to\nthe contradiction.\n\nFurther, η -equivalent functions in F* are not considered\nprovably equal. Otherwise, in combination with funext_on\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>F*<|>ORGANIZATION<|>F* is a programming language designed with an emphasis on formal verification, featuring a type system and tactics for proving properties about programs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SMT SOLVER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A tool used by F* to determine if terms are provably equal and to assist in type conversions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FSTAR.PERVASIVES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Part of the F* standard library that offers primitives for explicit type coercion based on equality proofs)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>F*<|>SMT SOLVER<|>F* uses an SMT solver to figure out when terms are provably equal and to perform type conversions<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>F*<|>FSTAR.PERVASIVES<|>F* includes FStar.Pervasives as part of its standard library for explicit type coercion<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

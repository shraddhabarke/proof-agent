In Rust,\nthe extracted code required the type argument to implement the Clone , Copy , and PartialEq traits. Currently we hardcode these traits. We plan to specify these traits\nin Pulse through attribute mechanism\n\n- The ghost arguments p and s appear in the Rust code as unit arguments, we plan\nto make it so that these arguments are completely erased.\n\n- Whereas majority needs only read permission for the votes array in the Pulse\nsignature, the extracted Rust code specifies the argument as &mut . The Rust extraction\npipeline currently passes all the references as mut , we plan to make\nit more precise by taking into account the permissions from the Pulse signature.\n\nPulse programs can also be extracted to C. The extraction pipeline is based on the Karamel tool. The process to extract Pulse\nprograms to C is similar to that of extracting Low* to C, described in this tutorial . In summary, we first generate .krml files from using the F* extraction command line option --codegen krml , and then\nrun the Karamel tool on those files.\n\nOne catch with extracting our Boyer-Moore implementation to C is that due to the lack\nof support of polymorphism in C, Karamel monomorphizes polymorphic functions based on\ntheir uses. So, we write a monomorphic version of the majority function for u32 ,\nthat internally calls the polymorphic majority function:\n\nfn majority_mono #p (#s:G.erased _) (votes:array u32_t) (len:SZ.t { SZ.v len == Seq.length s })\n  requires pts_to votes #p s ** pure (0 < SZ.v len /\\ SZ.fits (2 * SZ.v len))\n  returns x:option u32_t\n  ensures pts_to votes #p s **\n          pure ((x == None ==> no_majority s) /\\ (Some? x ==> (Some?.v x) `has_majority_in` s))\n{\n  majority #u32_t #p #s votes len\n}\n\n\nThen we extract it to C as follows (the commands are run in the pulse root directory as before):\n\n$ fstar.exe --include lib/pulse/ --include lib/pulse/lib\n  --include share/pulse/examples/by-example/ --include share/pulse/examples/_output/cache/\n  --load_cmxs pulse  --odir . PulseTutorial.Algorithms.fst\n  --extract 'FStar.Pervasives.Native PulseTutorial.Algorithms' --codegen krml\n\n$ ../karamel/krml -skip-compilation out.krml\n\n\nThis produces PulseTutorial_Algorithms.h and PulseTutorial_Algorithms.c files, with the following\nimplementation of majority :\n\nFStar_Pervasives_Native_option__uint32_t\nPulseTutorial_Algorithms_majority__uint32_t(uint32_t *votes, size_t len)\n{\n  size_t i = (size_t)1U;\n  size_t k = (size_t)1U;\n  uint32_t votes_0 = votes[0U];\n  uint32_t cand = votes_0;\n  size_t vi0 = i;\n  bool cond = vi0 < len;\n  while (cond)\n  {\n    size_t vi = i;\n    size_t vk = k;\n    uint32_t vcand = cand;\n    uint32_t votes_i = votes[vi];\n    if (vk == (size_t)0U)\n    {\n      cand = votes_i;\n      k = (size_t)1U;\n      i = vi + (size_t)1U;\n    }\n    else if (votes_i == vcand)\n    {\n      k = vk + (size_t)1U;\n      i = vi + (size_t)1U;\n    }\n    else\n    {\n      k = vk - (size_t)1U;\n      i = vi + (size_t)1U;\n    }\n    size_t vi0 = i;\n    cond = vi0 < len;\n  }\n  size_t vk = k;\n  uint32_t vcand = cand;\n  if (vk == (size_t)0U)\n    return ((FStar_Pervasives_Native_option__uint32_t){ .tag = FStar_Pervasives_Native_None });\n  else if (len < (size_t)2U * vk)\n    return\n      (\n        (FStar_Pervasives_Native_option__uint32_t){\n          .tag = FStar_Pervasives_Native_Some,\n          .v = vcand\n        }\n      );\n  else\n  {\n    i = (size_t)0U;\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The provided text is a technical description of a software development process involving Rust and C programming languages, focusing on the implementation and extraction of a majority function algorithm.

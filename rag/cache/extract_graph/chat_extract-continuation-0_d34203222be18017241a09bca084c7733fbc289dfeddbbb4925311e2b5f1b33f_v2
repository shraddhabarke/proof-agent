We will look at a semantics for ``while`` in a\nsubsequent chapter.\n\nOperational Semantics\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nOur first step in giving a semantics to programs is to define an\ninterpreter for it to run a program while transforming a memory that\nstores the values of the global variables.\n\nTo model this memory, we use the type ``state`` shown below:\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Imp.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: state$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: state$\n\nWriting a small evaluator for expressions is easy:\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Imp.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: eval_expr$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: eval_expr$\n\nThe interpreter for programs itself takes a bit more work, since\nprograms can both read and write the state. To structure our\ninterpreter, we'll introduce a simple state monad ``st a``. We've seen\nthis construction before in :ref:`a previous chapter\n<Part2_monad_intro>`---so, look there if the state monad is unfamiliar\nto you. Recall that F* has support for monadic let operators: the\n``let!`` provides syntactic sugar to convenient compose ``st`` terms.  \n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Imp.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: monad$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: monad$\n\nNow, the interpreter itself is a total, recursive function ``run`` which\ninterprets a program ``p`` as a state-passing function of type ``st\nunit``, or ``state -> unit & state``.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Imp.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: run$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: run$\n\nLet's look at its definition in detail:\n\n   * ``Assign x e``: Evaluate ``e`` in the current state and then\n     update the state with a new value of ``x``.\n\n   * ``Seq p1 p2``: Simply run ``p1`` and then run ``p2``, where\n     ``;!`` is syntactic sugar for ``let! _ = run p1 in run p2``.\n\n   * ``If e p1 p2``: Evaluate ``e`` in the current state, branch on\n     its result and run either ``p1`` or ``p2``\n\n   * ``Repeat e p``: Evaluate ``e`` to ``n``, and if ``n`` is\n     greater than zero, call the mutually recursive ``run_repeat n\n     p``. Most of the subtlety here is in convincing F* that this\n     mutually recursive function terminates, but this is fairly\n     straightforward once you know how---we discussed\n     :ref:`termination proofs for mutually recursive functions earlier\n     <Part1_mutual_recursion>`.\n\nThese operational semantics are the ground truth for our programming\nlanguage---it defines how programs execute. Now that we have that\nsettled, we can look at how a Floyd-Hoare logic makes it possible to\nreason about programs in a structured way.\n\nFloyd-Hoare Logic\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nThe goal of a Floyd-Hoare logic is to provide a way to reason about a\nprogram based on the structure of its syntax, rather than reasoning\ndirectly about its operational semantics. The unit of reasoning is\ncalled a *Hoare triple*, a predicate of the form ``{P} c {Q}``, where\n``P`` and ``Q`` are predicates about the state of the program, and\n``c`` is the program itself.\n\nWe can *define* Hoare triples for our language by interpreting them as\nan assertion about the operational semantics, where ``triple p c q``\nrepresents, formally, the Hoare triple ``{ p } c { q }``.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Imp.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: triple$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: triple$\n\nThe predicate ``triple p c q`` is valid, if when executing ``c`` in a\nstate that satisfies ``p`` results in a state that satisfies ``q``.\nThe predicates ``p`` and ``q`` are also called precondition and\npostcondition of ``c``, respectively.\n\nFor each syntactic construct of our language, we can prove a lemma\nthat shows how to build an instance of the ``triple`` predicate for\nthat construct. Then, to build a proof of program, one stitches\ntogether these lemmas to obtain a ``triple p main q``, a statement of\ncorrectess of the ``main`` program.\n\nAssignment\n++++++++++\n\nOur first rule is for reasoning about variable assignment:\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Imp.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: assignment$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: assignment$\n\nThis lemma says that ``post`` holds after executing ``\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SEQ<|>EVENT<|>Seq is used to compose programs sequentially)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IF<|>EVENT<|>If is used to compose programs conditionally)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REPEAT N P<|>EVENT<|>Repeat n p represents a construct similar to a for-loop, where the program p is repeated n times)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STATE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>State is used to model the memory that stores the values of the global variables in a program)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ST A<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A simple state monad used to structure the interpreter of a program)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RUN<|>EVENT<|>Run is a total, recursive function that interprets a program as a state-passing function)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FLOYD-HOARE LOGIC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A logic that provides a way to reason about a program based on the structure of its syntax)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HOARE TRIPLE<|>EVENT<|>A predicate of the form {P} c {Q}, used in Floyd-Hoare logic to reason about programs)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SEQ<|>RUN<|>Seq is a construct interpreted by the run function in the operational semantics of the programming language<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>IF<|>RUN<|>If is a construct interpreted by the run function in the operational semantics of the programming language<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>REPEAT N P<|>RUN<|>Repeat n p is a construct interpreted by the run function in the operational semantics of the programming language<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ST A<|>RUN<|>The run function utilizes the simple state monad st a to structure its interpretation of programs<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FLOYD-HOARE LOGIC<|>HOARE TRIPLE<|>Floyd-Hoare Logic uses Hoare triples as the unit of reasoning about programs<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

case, we can easily use the\n  induction hypothesis depending on which side actually stepped.\n\n* The ``Beta`` case is the most interesting and requires a lemma about\n  substitutions preserving typing.\n\nThe substitution lemma follows:\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Part2.STLC.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: substitution$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: substitution$\n\nIt starts with a notion of typability of substitutions, ``subst_typing\ns g1 g2``, which that if a variable ``x`` has type ``g1 x``, then ``s\nx`` must have that same type in ``g2``.\n\nThe substitution lemma lifts this notion to expressions, stating that\napplying a well-typed substitution ``subst_typing s g1 g2`` to a term\nwell-typed in ``g1`` produces a term well-typed in ``g2`` with the\nsame type.\n\nExercise\n--------\n\nUse the substitution lemma to state and prove the\n``substitution_beta`` lemma used in the proof of preservation.\n\n.. container:: toggle\n\n

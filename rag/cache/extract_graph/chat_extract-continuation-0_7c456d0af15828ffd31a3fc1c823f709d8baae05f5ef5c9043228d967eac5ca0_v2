Given the nature of the text, it appears to be a technical description related to programming or formal verification rather than containing explicit entities of the types organization, person, geo, or event. The text discusses concepts and functions within a programming or formal proof context, such as commutative monoids, variables, and data structures, which do not directly map to the specified entity types.\n\nHowever, if we were to interpret the request more broadly to include concepts or components as \"organizations\" (in a metaphorical sense as entities or systems within a programming or formal proof context), and terms or variables as \"persons\" (metaphorically as actors within these systems), the output would still be limited by the actual content provided. The text primarily focuses on explaining algorithms or functions for sorting, comparing, and canonicalizing expressions in a formal proof system, which does not straightforwardly translate into the specified entity and relationship format without a more creative or metaphorical interpretation.\n\nFor a more accurate extraction based on the given instructions and considering the nature of the text, it would be essential to have content that explicitly mentions organizations, people, geographical locations, or events.

You're\nprobably also wondering about how to prove that ``p[e/x]`` evaluates\nto ``true``---we will look at this in detail later. But, the short\nversion is that F*, by default, uses an SMT solver to prove such fact,\nthough you can also use tactics and other techniques to do so.\n\nAn example\n..........\n\nGiven ``x:even``, consider proving ``x + 1 : odd``; it takes a few\nsteps:\n\n1. The operator ``+`` is defined in F*'s library. It expects both its\n   arguments to have type ``int`` and returns an ``int``.\n\n2. To prove that the first argument ``x:even`` is a valid argument for\n   ``+``, we use refinement subtyping to eliminate the refinement and\n   obtain ``x:int``. The second argument ``1:int`` already has the\n   required type. Thus, ``x + 1 : int``.\n\n3. To conclude that ``x + 1 : odd``, we need to introduce a refinement\n   type, by proving that the refinement predicate of ``odd`` evaluates\n   to true, i.e., ``x + 1 % 2 = 1``. This is provable by SMT, since we\n   started with the knowledge that ``x`` is even.\n\nAs such, F* applies subtyping repeatedly to introduce and eliminate\nrefinement types, applying it multiple times even to check a simple\nterm like ``x + 1 : odd``.\n\n\nFunctions\n^^^^^^^^^\n\nWe need a way to define functions to start writing interesting\nprograms. In the core of F*, functions behave like functions in\nmaths. In other words, they are defined on their entire domain (i.e.,\nthey are total functions and always return a result) and their only\nobservable behavior is the result they return (i.e., they don't have\nany side effect, like looping forever, or printing a message etc.).\n\nFunctions are first-class values in F*, e.g., they can be passed as\narguments to other functions and returned as results. While F*\nprovides several ways to define functions, the most basic form is the\n:math:`\\lambda` term, also called a function literal, an anonymous function, or a\nsimply a *lambda*. The syntax is largely inherited from OCaml, and\nthis `OCaml tutorial\n<https://ocaml.org/learn/tutorials/basics.html#Defining-a-function>`_\nprovides more details for those unfamiliar with the language. We'll\nassume a basic familiarity with OCaml-like syntax.\n\nLambda terms\n............\n\nThe term ``fun (x:int) -> x + 1`` defines a function,\na lambda term, which adds 1 to its integer-typed parameter ``x``. You\ncan also let F* infer the type of the parameter and write ``fun x ->\nx + 1`` instead.\n\n.. _Part1_ch1_named_function:\n\nNamed functions\n...............\n\nAny term in F\\* can be given a name using a ``let`` binding. We'll\nwant this to define a function once and to call it many times. For\nexample, all of the following are synonyms and bind the lambda term\n``fun x -> x + 1`` to the name ``incr``\n\n.. code-block:: fstar\n\n  let incr = fun (x:int) -> x + 1\n  let incr (x:int) = x + 1\n  let incr x = x + 1\n\nFunctions can take several arguments and the result type of a function\ncan also be annotated, if desired\n\n.. code-block:: fstar\n\n  let incr (x:int) : int = x + 1\n  let more_than_twice (x:int) (y:int) : bool = x > y + y\n\nIt's considered good practice to annotate all the parameters and\nresult type of a named function definition.\n\n.. note::\n\n   In addition to decorating the types of parameters and the results\n   of function, F* allows annotating any term ``e`` with its expected\n   type ``t`` by writing ``e <: t``. This is called a *type\n   ascription*. An ascription instructs F* to check that the\n   term ``e`` has the type ``t``. For example, we could have written\n\n.. code-block:: fstar\n\n     let incr = fun (x:int) -> (x + 1 <: int)\n\n\nRecursive functions\n...................\n\nRecursive functions in F* are always named. To define them, one uses\nthe ``let rec`` syntax, as shown below.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Part1.GettingOffTheGround.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: SNIPPET_START: factorial\n   :end-before: SNIPPET\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>F*<|>ORGANIZATION<|>F* is a programming language that uses a refinement type system and SMT solvers to prove properties about programs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SMT SOLVER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A tool used by F* to automatically prove logical statements, especially those involving refinement types)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OCAML<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A programming language from which F* inherits its syntax for defining functions and lambda terms)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INT<|>GEO<|>In the context of F*, 'int' refers to the integer type, a basic data type for numbers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EVEN<|>EVENT<|>A refinement type in F* that specifies integers divisible by 2)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ODD<|>EVENT<|>A refinement type in F* that specifies integers that, when divided by 2, have a remainder of 1)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EVEN<|>INT<|>The 'even' refinement type is a subset of the 'int' type, specifying only those integers divisible by 2<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ODD<|>INT<|>The 'odd' refinement type is a subset of the 'int' type, specifying only those integers with a remainder of 1 when divided by 2<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>F*<|>SMT SOLVER<|>F* uses SMT solvers to automatically prove properties about programs, especially for refinement types<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>F*<|>OCAML<|>F* inherits its syntax for defining functions and lambda terms from OCaml<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

It's much like the\n    proof by induction we discussed in detail earlier, except now we\n    have two uses of the induction hypothesis.\n\n    * It's a proof by induction on ``n:nat{n >= 2}``, as you can tell from the\n      ``let rec``.\n\n    * The base cases are when ``n = 2`` and ``n = 3``. In both these\n      cases, the solver can simply compute ``fibonacci n`` and check\n      that it is greater than ``n``.\n\n    * Otherwise, in the inductive case, we have ``n >= 4`` and the\n      induction hypothesis is the type of the recursive function::\n\n        m:nat{m >= 2 /\\ m < n} -> Lemma (fibonacci m >= m)\n\n    * We call the induction hypothesis twice and get::\n\n        fibonacci (n - 1) >= n - 1\n        fibonacci (n - 2) >= n - 2\n\n    * To conclude, we show::\n\n        fibonacci n = //by definition\n        fibonacci (n - 1) + fibonacci (n - 2) >= //from the facts above\n        (n - 1) + (n - 2) = //rearrange\n        2*n - 3 >=  //when n >= 4\n        n\n\n    As you can see, once you set up the induction, the SMT solver does\n    a lot of the work.\n\n    Sometimes, the SMT solver can even find proofs that you might not\n    write yourself. Consider this alternative proof of ``fibonacci n\n    >= n``.\n\n    .. literalinclude:: ../code/Part1.Lemmas.fst\n       :language: fstar\n       :start-after: SNIPPET_START: fibonacci_answer_alt\n       :end-before: SNIPPET_END: fibonacci_answer_alt\n\n    This proof works with just a single use of the induction\n    hypothesis. How come? Let's look at it in detail.\n\n    1. It's a proof by induction on ``n:nat{n >= 2}``.\n\n    2. The base case is when ``n=2``. It's easy to compute ``fibonacci 2``\n       and check that it's greater than or equal to 2.\n\n    3. In the inductive case, we have::\n\n        n >= 3\n\n    4. The induction hypothesis is::\n\n         m:nat{m >= 2 /\\ m < n} -> Lemma (fibonacci m >= m)\n\n    5. We apply the induction hypothesis to ``n - 1`` and get ::\n\n        fibonacci (n - 1) >= n - 1\n\n    6.

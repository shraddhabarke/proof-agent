This can be accomplished in a SystemVerilog testbench by setting one of two counters directly on a memory instance. For example:\n\ndut.memory_instance_name.correctable_errors_to_inject_ff = 16;\n\nwill cause up to 16 correctable errors to be injected during memory writes.\n\nSimilarly:\n\ndut.memory_instance_name.uncorrectable_errors_to_inject_ff = 32;\n\nwill cause up to 32 uncorrectable errors to be injected during memory writes.\n\n\nInterpreter options\n\nThere are a number of options that can be passed to the interpreter, they are enumerated in the header file KanagawaInterpreter.h. The options include the following.\n\n- PbOption_verbose Print most of the execution events\n- PbOption_executionTrace Print every bytecode instruction executed\n- PbOption_cppTrace Print basic block entry and exit events\n- PbOption_sourceTrace Print source file and line number executed\n- PbOption_traceFifos Print FIFO enqueue/dequeue operations\n- PbOption_traceExtern Print calls to external simulation functions\n- PbOption_parseOnly No execution, only parse the bytecode file. Use in conjunction with the verbose option.\n- PbOption_deepDisasm Generate a more verbose disassembly\n- PbOption_singleThreaded Execute sequentially even on a multiprocessor\n- PbOption_noBackpressure Use FIFOs of infinite depth\n- PbOption_overflowPrint Print if the assigned depth of a FIFO is exceeded\n- `PbOption_printCycles’ Tag the output from println() with the current cycle counter value\n- PbOption_initRandom Use random numbers for un-initialized values of memories and global registers\n- PbOption_initZero Use zero for un-initialized values of memories and global registers\n- PbOption_initAllOnes Use all-ones (0xfff….) for un-initialized values of memories and global registers\n\nPbOption_verbose Print most of the execution events\n\nPbOption_executionTrace Print every bytecode instruction executed\n\nPbOption_cppTrace Print basic block entry and exit events\n\nPbOption_sourceTrace Print source file and line number executed\n\nPbOption_traceFifos Print FIFO enqueue/dequeue operations\n\nPbOption_traceExtern Print calls to external simulation functions\n\nPbOption_parseOnly No execution, only parse the bytecode file. Use in conjunction with the verbose option.\n\nPbOption_deepDisasm Generate a more verbose disassembly\n\nPbOption_singleThreaded Execute sequentially even on a multiprocessor\n\nPbOption_noBackpressure Use FIFOs of infinite depth\n\nPbOption_overflowPrint Print if the assigned depth of a FIFO is exceeded\n\n`PbOption_printCycles’ Tag the output from println() with the current cycle counter value\n\nPbOption_initRandom Use random numbers for un-initialized values of memories and global registers\n\nPbOption_initZero Use zero for un-initialized values of memories and global registers\n\nPbOption_initAllOnes Use all-ones (0xfff….) for un-initialized values of memories and global registers\n\nWhen using the option PbOption_initRandom the interpreter prints the value of the seed used for the random number generator. The seed is obtained by the time-of-day function, and will therefore change on every run. It is possible to select a specific seed by setting the environment variable KANAGAWA_INTERPRETER_RANDOM_SEED_VALUE . The value is in decimal.\n\nWhen simulating an external DRAM module the default value for un-initialized locations is zero. The user code compilation-time macro PIPEDREAM_UNINITIALIZED_DRAM_VALUE can be predefined to select a different 64-bit base pattern.\n\n\nTracing options for the interpreter\n\nThe option PbOption_waveform causes the interpreter to create a trace file that describes the incremental changes occurring during execution. This trace file can later be used to reproduce the execution at a fine level of detail. For instance, the Sandpiper debugger can use the trace instead of the interpreter for debugging.\n\nOne use case is for bugs that occur non-deterministically: the trace allows a faithful reproduction for later debugging.\n\nAnother use case is for reporting errors to the Sandpiper team, without requiring them to rebuild the entire user application.\n\nAdditional use cases are for studying the performance of the Sandpiper program at the basic block level.\n\nThe default trace filename is PbTrace.txt . It can be changed by setting the environment variable KANAGAWA_INTERPRETER_TRACE_FILE .\n\n\nCreating VCD files\n\nThe Value Change Dump (VCD) format is an IEEE standard for representing traces, especially as generated by HDL simulators. This Wikipedia article describes the format of VCD files: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_change_dump\n\nConverting a Sandpiper trace to the VCD format is performed by the WaveformReader tool:\n\nWaveformReader --output MyPbTrace.vcd --vcd MyDebugSymbols.csv MyPbTrace.txt\n\nwhere MyDebugSymbols.csv are the debug symbols for the Sandpiper program, and MyPbTrace.txt is a Sandpiper trace, for instance generated by the interpreter using the option PbOption_waveform . The output goes to the file MyPbTrace.vcd . The default output file is called wave.vcd .\n\nThe Sandpiper Debugger will generate VCD traces when using the wave option in the launch.json configuration file. The value of the wave option is a file path.\n\n\nViewing VCD files\n\nVCD files can be viewed graphically by various tools, for instance GTKWave: https://sourceforge.net/projects/gtkwave/\n\nThe Questa simulator requires an additional step to tranform the file into their proprietary format Waveform Log File (WLF). The Questa distribution includes a command line tool to perform this conversion:\n\nvcd2wlf.exe MyPbTrace.vcd MyPbTrace.wlf\n\nAfter opening MyPbTrace.wlf from Questa’s File::Open menu, the user can add\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SYSTEMVERILOG<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A hardware description and verification language used in electronic design automation to model, design, simulate, test and verify electronic systems)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KANAGAWAINTERPRETER.H<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Header file for the Kanagawa Interpreter, detailing options for simulation behavior and control)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SANDPIPER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A tool or program associated with the Kanagawa Interpreter, possibly for debugging or enhancing simulation processes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WAVEFORMREADER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A tool for converting Sandpiper traces into the VCD format, facilitating the analysis of simulation data)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GTKWAVE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A VCD (Value Change Dump) viewer that allows for graphical representation of simulation traces)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>QUESTA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A simulation platform that may require conversion of VCD files to its proprietary WLF format for viewing)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KANAGAWAINTERPRETER.H<|>SYSTEMVERILOG<|>KanagawaInterpreter.h provides options for controlling simulations written in SystemVerilog<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SANDPIPER<|>KANAGAWAINTERPRETER.H<|>Sandpiper uses or is related to the options defined in KanagawaInterpreter.h for simulation purposes<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WAVEFORMREADER<|>SANDPIPER<|>WaveformReader converts Sandpiper simulation traces into VCD format<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GTKWAVE<|>WAVEFORMREADER<|>GTKWave can be used to view VCD files generated by WaveformReader<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QUESTA<|>WAVEFORMREADER<|>Questa requires VCD files converted by WaveformReader for viewing in its proprietary format<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

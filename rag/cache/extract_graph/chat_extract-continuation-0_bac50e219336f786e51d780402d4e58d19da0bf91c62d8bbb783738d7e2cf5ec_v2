That is, while one can build an invariant such as inv i (exists* v. pts_to x v) , one cannot nest invariants, i.e., there\nis no meaningful way to construct an instance of inv i (inv j p) .\n\nThis restriction is a fundamental limitation of PulseCore: invariants\ncannot mention other invariants. In more technical terms, invariants\nare predicative . One might wonder whether this limitation is\nsignificant: after all, why might one want to construct an invariant\nthat states that some p is already an invariant? It turns out that\nsuch predicates, although not very common, are useful and the\ninability to nest invariants in Pulse makes some styles of proofs\nawkward or perhaps even impossible. Nevertheless, forcing invariants\nto be predicative gives Pulse a simple foundational model in PulseCore\nin terms of a standard, predicative, dependently typed logic.\n\nLet’s look next at how to turn a boxable predicate into an invariant.\n\nLet’s start by looking at how to create an invariant.\n\nFirst, let’s define a predicate owns x , to mean that we hold\nfull-permission on x .\n\nlet owns (x:ref U32.t) : v:vprop { is_big v }= exists* v. pts_to x v\n\n\nNotice the type annotation on owns claims that it is boxable ,\nand indeed F*’s refinement type checker automatically proves that it\nis.\n\nNow, if we can currently prove pts_to r x then we can turn it into\nan invariant inv i (owns r) , as shown below.\n\nghost\nfn create_invariant (r:ref U32.t) (v:erased U32.t)\nrequires pts_to r v\nreturns i:iref\nensures inv i (owns r)\n{\n    fold owns;\n    new_invariant (owns r)\n}\n\n\nImportantly, when we turn pts_to r x into inv i (owns r) , we\nlose ownership of pts_to r x . Remember, once we have inv i (owns r) , Pulse’s logic aims to prove that owns r remains true\nalways. If we were allowed to retain pts_to r x , while also\ncreating an inv i (owns r) , we can clearly break the invariant,\ne.g., by freeing r .\n\nNote\n\nA tip: When using an inv i p , it’s a good idea to make sure\nthat p is a user-defined predicate. For example, one might\nthink to just write inv i (exists* v. pts_to x v) instead of\ndefining an auxiliary predicate for inv i (owns r) . However, the\nsome of the proof obligations produced by the Pulse checker are\nharder for the SMT solver to prove if you don’t use the auxiliary\npredicate and you may start to see odd failures. This is something\nwe’re working to improve. In the meantime, use an auxiliary\npredicate.\n\nNote, if one were to try to allocate an invariant for a non-boxable predicate,\ntypechecking fails, as shown in the example below:\n\nghost\nfn create_non_boxable_inv (p:vprop)\nrequires p\nreturns i:iref\nensures inv i p\n{\n  new_invariant p;\n}\n\n\nfailing with an error pointing to the source location of the\nrefinement precondition, is_big , at the call to new_invariant .\n\n- Assertion failed\n- The SMT solver could not prove the query. Use --query_stats for more details.\n- See also ../../../lib/pulse/lib/Pulse.Lib.Core.fsti(536,29-536,37)\n\n\nAs you can see, although the language does not prevent you from\nwriting inv i p for any predicate p , the only way to allocate\nan instance of inv i p is by provable that p is boxable . This design is convenient since the onus of proving that\na predicate is boxable is only placed at the allocation site of the\ninvariant—uses of invariants do not need to worry about the\ndistinction between boxable and general vprops .\n\nNow that we’ve allocated an inv i (owns r) , what can we do with it?\nAs we said earlier, one can make use of the owns r in an atomic\ncomputation, so long as we restore it at the end of the atomic\nstep.\n\nThe with_invariants construct gives us access to the invariant\nwithin the scope of at most one atomic step, preceded or succeeded by\nas many ghost or unobservable steps as needed.\n\nThe general form of with_invariants is as follows, to “open”\ninvariants i_1 to i_k in the scope of e .\n\nwith_invariants i_1 ... i_k\nreturns x:t\nensures post\n{ e }\n\n\nIn many cases, the returns and ensures annotations are\nomitted, since it can be inferred.\n\nThis is syntactic sugar for the following nest:\n\nwith_invariants i_1 {\n ...\n  with_invariants i_k\n  returns x:t\n  ensures post\n  { e }\n ...\n}\n\n\nHere’s the rule for opening a single invariant inv i p using with_invariant i { e } is as follows:\n\n- i must have type iref and inv i p must be provable in\nthe current context, for some p:vprop\n\n- e must have the type stt_atomic t j (p ** r) (fun x -> p ** s x) . [ 1 ] That is, e requires and restores the invariant p ,\nwhile also transforming r to s x , all in at most one atomic\nstep. Further, the name_of_inv i must not be in the set j .\n\n- with_invariants i { e } has type stt_atomic t (\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PULSECORE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>PulseCore is a foundational model in Pulse that restricts invariants to be predicative and not mention other invariants, aiming for a simple model based on a standard, predicative, dependently typed logic)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>F*<|>ORGANIZATION<|>F* is a refinement type checker that automatically proves certain predicates to be boxable, facilitating the creation of invariants in Pulse)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INV I (OWNS R)<|>EVENT<|>An invariant created when a predicate pts_to r x is proven, turning it into a permanent assertion that owns r remains true, under the condition that ownership of pts_to r x is relinquished)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PULSECORE<|>INV I (OWNS R)<|>PulseCore's design restricts the creation of invariants like inv i (owns r) to ensure they are predicative and do not mention other invariants<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>F*<|>INV I (OWNS R)<|>F*'s refinement type checker plays a crucial role in proving predicates like owns r to be boxable, enabling their use as invariants in Pulse<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

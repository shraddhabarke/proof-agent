[ 1 ] The wp argument is also called an index of the PURE effect. [ 2 ]\n\nThe return operator for wp a is shown below: it is analogous to\nthe WP c Q and WP x Q rules for variables and constants that\nwe showed earlier:\n\nlet return_wp (#a:Type) (x:a) : wp a = fun post -> post x\n\n\nThe bind operator for wp a is analogous to the rule for sequencing\nWPs, i.e., the rule for WP (let x = e1 in e2) Q above:\n\nlet bind_wp (#a #b:Type) (wp1:wp a) (wp2:a -> wp b)\n  : wp b\n  = fun post -> wp1 (fun x -> wp2 x post)                \n\n\nFinally, analogous to the WP rule for conditionals, one can write a\ncombinator for composing wp a in a branch:\n\nlet if_then_else_wp (#a:Type) (b:bool) (wp1 wp2:wp a)\n  : wp a\n  = fun post -> if b then wp1 post else wp2 post\n\n\nThis is the essence of the Dijkstra monad construction for pure\nprograms: the rule for computing weakest preconditions for a\ncomputation returning a value x is return_wp ; the rule for\ncomputing the WP of the sequential composition of terms is the\nsequential composition of WPs using bind_wp ; the rule for\ncomputing the WP of a conditional term is the conditional composition\nof WPs using if_then_else_wp .\n\nIf fact, if one thinks of pure computations as the identity monad, tot a as shown below:\n\nlet tot (a:Type) = a\nlet return_tot (#a:Type) (x:a) : tot a = x\nlet bind_tot (#a #b:Type) (x:tot a) (y:a -> tot b)\n  : tot b\n  = let v = x in y v\n\n\nthen the parallel between the tot monad and wp becomes even\nclearerâ€”the WP analog of return_tot is return_wp and of bind_tot is bind_wp .\n\nIt turns out that wp a (for monotonic weakest preconditions) is\nitself a monad, as shown below by a proof of the monad laws:\n\n(* A monotonic WP maps stronger postconditions to stronger preconditions *)\nlet monotonic (#a:Type) (wp:wp a) =\n  forall (p q:post a). (forall x. p x ==> q x) ==> (wp p ==> wp q)\n\nlet mwp (a:Type) = w:wp a { monotonic w }\n\n(* An equivalence relation on WPs *)\nlet ( =~= ) (#a:Type) (wp1 wp2:wp a)\n  : prop\n  = forall post. wp1 post <==> wp2 post\n\n(* The three monad laws *)\nlet left_identity (a b:Type) (x:a) (wp:a -> mwp a)\n  : Lemma (bind_wp (return_wp x) wp =~= wp x)\n  = ()\n\nlet right_identity (a b:Type) (wp:mwp a)\n  : Lemma (wp =~= (bind_wp wp return_wp))\n  = ()\n\nlet associativity (a b c:Type) (wp1:mwp a) (wp2:a -> mwp b) (wp3:b -> mwp c)\n  : Lemma (bind_wp wp1 (fun x -> bind_wp (wp2 x) wp3) =~=\n           bind_wp (bind_wp wp1 wp2) wp3)\n  = ()\n\n\nIt is also possible to define post a = a -> prop and pre = prop . However, the F* libraries for pure WPs using Type0 instead of prop , so we remain faithful to that\nhere.\n\nDijkstra monads are also related to the continuation\nmonad. Continuation monad models Continuation Passing Style programming, where the control is passed to the callee\nexplicitly in the form of a continuation. For a result type r , the continuation monad is defined as follows:\n\nlet cont (r:Type) (a:Type) = (a -> r) -> r  // (a -> r) is the continuation\nlet return #r (#a:Type) (x:a) : cont r a = fun k -> k x\nlet bind #r (#a #b:Type) (f:cont r a) (g:a -> cont r b)\n  : cont r b\n  =  fun k -> f (fun x -> g x k)\n\n\nIf we squint a bit, we can see that the wp monad we defined\nearlier, is nothing but a continuation into Type0 , i.e., wp a = cont Type0 a (or cont prop a , if one prefers to\nuse prop ).\n\nWhen typechecking a program, F* computes a weakest precondition which\ncharacterizes a necessary condition for the program to satisfy all its\ntyping constraints. This computed weakest precondition is usually\nhidden from the programmer, but if you annotate your program suitably,\nyou can get access to it, as shown in the code snippet below:\n\nlet square (n:int) \n  : PURE nat (as_pure_wp #nat (fun q -> n*n >= 0 /\\ q (n * n)))\n  = n * n\n\n\nThe type says that square n is a pure function, which for any\npostcondition q:nat -> prop ,\n\n- Is defined only when n\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PURE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A concept or model related to programming, specifically in the context of computing weakest preconditions for pure programs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A function transforming postconditions to preconditions in the context of Dijkstra monad construction for pure programs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MONADIC WP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Represents a monad for monotonic weakest preconditions, proving the monad laws and allowing for the computation of weakest preconditions in programming)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CONTINUATION MONAD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Models Continuation Passing Style programming, where control is passed explicitly in the form of a continuation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>F*<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A programming language that computes weakest preconditions for program typechecking, allowing programmers to access these preconditions through annotations)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WP<|>PURE<|>WP is used within the context of PURE programming to compute weakest preconditions<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MONADIC WP<|>WP<|>Monadic WP extends the concept of WP by applying monad laws to weakest preconditions<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CONTINUATION MONAD<|>WP<|>The WP monad is analogous to the continuation monad, highlighting a continuation into Type0<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>F*<|>WP<|>F* uses WP to compute necessary conditions for programs to satisfy typing constraints<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

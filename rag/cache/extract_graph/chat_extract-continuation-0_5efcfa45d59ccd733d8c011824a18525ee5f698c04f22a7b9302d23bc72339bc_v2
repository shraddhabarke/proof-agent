Along the way,\nwe’ll see uses of recursive predicates, trades, and universal\nquantification.\n\nLet’s start by defining the type of a singly linked list:\n\nnoeq\ntype node (t:Type0) = {\n    head : t;\n    tail : llist t;\n}\n\nand node_ptr (t:Type0) = ref (node t)\n\n//A nullable pointer to a node\nand llist (t:Type0) = option (node_ptr t)\n\n\nA node t contains a head:t and a tail:llist t , a nullable\nreference pointing to the rest of the list. Nullable references are\nrepresented by an option, as we saw before .\n\nNext, we need a predicate to relate a linked list to a logical\nrepresentation of the list, for use in specifications.\n\nlet rec is_list #t (x:llist t) (l:list t)\n: Tot vprop (decreases l)\n= match l with\n  | [] -> pure (x == None)\n  | head::tl -> \n    exists* (p:node_ptr t) (tail:llist t).\n      pure (x == Some p) **\n      pts_to p { head; tail } **\n      is_list tail tl\n\n\nThe predicate is_list x l is a recursive predicate:\n\n- When l == [] , the reference x must be null.\n\n- Otherwise, l == head :: tl , x must contains a valid\nreference p , where p points to { head; tail } and,\nrecursively , we have is_list tail tl .\n\nWe’ve seen recursive predicates in a previous chapter , and just as we did there, we need some\nhelper ghost functions to work with is_list . We expect the Pulse\nchecker will automate these boilerplate ghost lemmas in the future,\nbut, for now, we are forced to write them by hand.\n\n```pulse\nghost\nfn elim_is_list_nil (#t:Type0) (x:llist t)\nrequires is_list x 'l ** pure ('l == [])\nensures pure (x == None)\n{\n   rewrite each 'l as Nil #t;\n   unfold (is_list x [])\n}\n```\n\n```pulse\nghost\nfn intro_is_list_nil (#t:Type0) (x:llist t)\nrequires pure (x == None)\nensures is_list x []\n{\n    fold (is_list x []);\n}\n```\n\n```pulse\nghost\nfn elim_is_list_cons (#t:Type0) (x:llist t) (l:list t) (head:t) (tl:list t)\nrequires is_list x l ** pure (l == head::tl)\nensures (\n  exists* (p:node_ptr t) (tail:llist t).\n    pure (x == Some p) **\n    pts_to p { head; tail } **\n    is_list tail tl\n)\n{\n  rewrite each l as (head::tl);\n  unfold (is_list x (head::tl));\n}\n```\n    \n\n```pulse\nghost\nfn intro_is_list_cons (#t:Type0) (x:llist t) (v:node_ptr t) (#node:node t) (#tl:list t)\nrequires\n  pts_to v node **\n  is_list node.tail tl **\n  pure (x == Some v)\nensures\n  is_list x (node.head::tl)\n{\n    rewrite (pts_to v node) as (pts_to v { head=node.head; tail=node.tail });\n    fold (is_list x (node.head::tl));\n}\n```\n\n\nWhen working with a linked list, the first thing we’ll do, typically,\nis to check whether a given x:llist t is null or not. However, the is_list x l predicate is defined by case analyzing l:list t rather than x:llist t , since that is makes it possible to write\nthe predicate by recursing on the tail of l . So, below, we have a\npredicate is_list_cases x l that inverts is_list x l predicate\nbased on whether or not x is null.\n\nlet is_list_cases #t (x:llist t) (l:list t)\n: vprop \n= match x with\n  | None -> pure (l == [])\n  | Some v -> \n    exists* (n:node t) (tl:list t).\n      pts_to v n **\n      pure (l == n.head::tl) **\n      is_list n.tail tl\n\n\nNext, we define a ghost function to invert is_list into is_list_cases .\n\nghost\nfn cases_of_is_list #t (x:llist t) (l:list t)\nrequires is_list x l\nensures is_list_cases x l\n{\n  match l {\n    Nil -> { \n      unfold (is_list x []);\n      fold (is_list_cases None l);\n      rewrite each (None #(ref (node t))) as x;\n    }\n    Cons head tl -> { \n      unfold (is_list x (head::tl));\n      with w tail. _;\n      let v = Some?.v x;\n      rewrite each w as v;\n      rewrite each tail as (({ head; tail }).tail) in (is_list tail tl);\n      fold (is_list_cases (Some v) l);\n      rewrite each (Some #(ref (node t)) v) as x;\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\nWe also define two more ghost functions that package up the call to cases_of_is_list .\n\nghost\nfn is_list_case_none (#t:Type) (x:llist t) (#l:list t)\nrequires is_list x l ** pure (x == None)\nensures is_list x l ** pure (l == [])\n{\n  cases_of_is_list x l;\n  rewrite each x as\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>NODE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A structure in a singly linked list containing a head of type t and a tail that points to the rest of the list)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NODE_PTR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A nullable pointer to a node, facilitating the construction of linked lists)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LLIST<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Represents a linked list, which can be null, indicating the end of the list)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IS_LIST<|>EVENT<|>A recursive predicate that relates a linked list to its logical representation for use in specifications)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PULSE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A checker expected to automate boilerplate ghost lemmas in the future)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NODE<|>LLIST<|>A node contains a tail that is a nullable reference to an llist, forming the basis of a linked list<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NODE_PTR<|>NODE<|>Node_ptr is a reference to a node, directly linking the two in the structure of a linked list<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LLIST<|>NODE_PTR<|>Llist can be an option of node_ptr, indicating it is part of the linked list structure<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>IS_LIST<|>LLIST<|>Is_list is a predicate function that operates on llist to check its structure and contents<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PULSE<|>IS_LIST<|>Pulse is expected to automate the creation of ghost lemmas like is_list in the future<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

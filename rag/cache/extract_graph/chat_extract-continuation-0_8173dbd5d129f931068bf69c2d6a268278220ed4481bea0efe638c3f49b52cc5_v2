In the implementation of to_string , we use\nthe instance i (just a record, sometimes called a dictionary in\nthe typeclass literature) and project its to_string field and\napply it to x .\n\nDefining an instance p x1..xn : t = e is just\nlike an ordinary let binding let p x1..xn : t = e , however the instance keyword instructs F*’s type inference algorithm to\nconsider using p when trying to instantiate implicit arguments\nfor typeclass instances.\n\nFor example, at the call site to_string (x:bool) , having unified\nthe implicit type arguments a with bool , what remains is to\nfind an instance of printable bool . F* looks through the current\ncontext for all variable bindings in the local scope, and instance declarations in the top-level scope, for a instance of printable bool , taking the first one it is able to construct.\n\nThe resolution procedure for to_string [[1;2;3]] is a bit more\ninteresting, since we need to find an instance printable (list int) , although no such ground instance exists. However, the\ntypeclass resolution procedure finds the printable_list instance\nfunction, whose result type printable (list a) matches the goal printable (list int) , provided a = int . The resolution\nprocedure then spawns a sub-goal printable int , which it solves\neasily and completes the derivation of printable (list int) .\n\nThis backwards, goal-directed search for typeclass resolution is a\nkind of logic programming. An interesting implementation detail is\nthat most of the typeclass machinery is defined as a metaprogran in FStar.Tactics.Typeclasses , outside of the core of F*’s\ncompiler. As such, the behavior of typeclass resolution is entirely\nuser-customizable, simply by revising the metaprogram in use. Some\ndetails about how this works can be found in a paper on Meta F* .\n\nDefine instances of printable for string , a & b , option a , and either a b . Check that you can write to_string [Inl (0, 1); Inr (Inl (Some true)); Inr (Inr \"hello\") ] and have F* infer the\ntypeclass instance needed.\n\nAlso write the typeclass instances you need explicitly, just to check\nthat you understand how things work. This is exercise should also\nconvey that typeclasses do not increase the expressive power in any\nway—whatever is expressible with typeclasses, is also expressible by\nexplicitly passing records that contain the operations needed on\nspecific type parameters. However, expliciting passing this operations\ncan quickly become overwhelming—typeclass inference keeps this\ncomplexity in check and makes it possible to build programs in an\ngeneric, abstract style without too much pain.\n\nThis exercise file provides\nthe definitions you need.\n\nAnswer\n\ninstance printable_string : printable string =\n{\n  to_string = fun x -> \"\\\"\" ^ x ^ \"\\\"\"\n}\n\ninstance printable_pair #a #b {| printable a |} {| printable b |} : printable (a & b) =\n{\n  to_string = (fun (x, y) -> \"(\" ^ to_string x ^ \", \" ^ to_string y ^ \")\")\n}\n\ninstance printable_option #a {| printable a |} : printable (option a) =\n{\n  to_string = (function None -> \"None\" | Some x -> \"(Some \" ^ to_string x ^ \")\")\n}\n\ninstance printable_either #a #b {| printable a |} {| printable b |} : printable (either a b) =\n{\n  to_string = (function Inl x -> \"(Inl \" ^ to_string x ^ \")\" | Inr x -> \"(Inr \" ^ to_string x ^ \")\")\n}\n\nlet _ = to_string [Inl (0, 1); Inr (Inl (Some true)); Inr (Inr \"hello\") ]\n\n//You can always pass the typeclass instance you want explicitly, if you really want to\n//typeclass resolution really saves you from LOT of typing!\nlet _ = to_string #_\n             #(printable_list\n                (printable_either #_ #_ #(printable_pair #_ #_ #printable_int #printable_int)\n                                        #(printable_either #_ #_ #(printable_option #_ #printable_bool)\n                                                                 #(printable_string))))\n             [Inl (0, 1); Inr (Inl (Some true)); Inr (Inr \"hello\")]\n\n\nThe printable typeclass is fairly standard and can be defined in\nalmost any language that supports typeclasses. We now turn to a\ntypeclass that leverages F*’s dependent types by generalizing the\ninterface of bounded unsigned integers that we developed in a previous chapter .\n\nA type a is in the class bounded_unsigned_int , when it\nadmits:\n\n- An element bound : a , representing the maximum value\n\n- A pair of functions from_nat and to_nat that form a\nbijection between a and natural numbers less than to_nat bound\n\nThis is captured by the class below:\n\nclass bounded_unsigned_int (a:Type) = {\n   bound      : a;\n   as_nat     : a -> nat;\n   from_nat   : (x:nat { x <= as_nat bound }) -> a;\n   [@@@FStar.Tactics.Typeclasses.no_method]\n   properties : squash (\n     (forall (x:a). as_nat x <= as_nat bound) /\\ // the bound is really an upper bound\n     (forall (x:a). from_nat (as_nat x) == x) /\\ //from_nat/as_nat form a bijection\n     (forall (x:nat{ x <= as_nat bound}). as_nat\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

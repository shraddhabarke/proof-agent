two forms, corresponding to\nprojecting each component of the pair.\n\nlet and_elim_1 #p #q (pf_pq:p & q)\n  : p\n  = pf_pq._1\n\nlet and_elim_2 #p #q (pf_pq:p & q)\n  : q\n  = pf_pq._2\n\n\nFor the squashed version, we again have two styles, the first relying\non the SMT solver.\n\nlet conj_elim_1 #p #q (pf_pq:squash (p /\\ q))\n  : squash p\n  = ()\n\nlet conj_elim_2 #p #q (pf_pq:squash (p /\\ q))\n  : squash q\n  = ()\n\n\nAnd a style using syntactic sugar:\n\nlet conj_elim_sugar_1 #p #q (pf_pq:squash (p /\\ q))\n  : squash p\n  = eliminate p /\\ q\n    returns p\n    with pf_p pf_q. pf_p\n\nlet conj_elim_sugar_2 #p #q (pf_pq:squash (p /\\ q))\n  : squash p\n  = eliminate p /\\ q\n    returns q\n    with pf_p pf_q. pf_q\n\n\nA constructive proof of p or q is represented by the following\ninductive type:\n\ntype sum (p q:Type) =\n  | Left : p -> sum p q\n  | Right : q -> sum p q\n\n\nThe constructors Left and Right inject proofs of p or q into a proof of sum p q .\n\nNote\n\nJust like before, this type is isomorphic to the type either p q from FStar.Pervasives .\n\nThe classical connective \\/ described previously is just a\nsquashed version of sum .\n\nlet ( \\/ ) (p q: Type) = squash (sum p q)\n\n\nAs with the other connectives, introducing a constructive disjunction\nis just a matter of using the Left or Right constructor.\n\nTo introduce the squashed version \\/ , one can either rely on the\nSMT solver, as shown below.\n\nlet or_intro_left #p #q (pf_p:squash p)\n  : squash (p \\/ q)\n  = ()\n\nlet or_intro_right #p #q (pf_q:squash q)\n  : squash (p \\/ q)\n  = ()\n\n\nOr, using the following syntactic sugar, one can specifically provide\na proof for either the Left or Right disjunct.\n\nlet or_intro_sugar_left #p #q (pf_p:squash p)\n  : squash (p \\/ q)\n  = introduce p \\/ q\n    with Left pf_p\n\nlet or_intro_sugar_right #p #q (pf_q:squash q)\n  : squash (p \\/ q)\n  = introduce p \\/ q\n    with Right pf_q\n\n\nEliminating a disjunction requires a motive , a goal proposition to\nbe derived from a proof of sum p q or p \\/ q .\n\nIn constructive style, eliminating sum p q amounts to just\npattern matching on the cases and constructing a proof of the goal\nby applying a suitable goal-producing hypothesis.\n\nlet sum_elim #p #q #r (p_or_q: sum p q)\n                         (pr: p -> r)\n                         (qr: q -> r)\n  : r\n  = match p_or_q with\n    | Left p -> pr p\n    | Right q -> qr q\n\n\nThe squashed version is similar, except the case analysis can either\nbe automated by SMT or explicitly handled using the syntactic\nsugar.\n\nlet or_elim #p #q #r (pf_p:squash (p \\/ q))\n                     (pf_pr:squash (p ==> r))\n                     (pf_qr:squash (q ==> r))\n  : squash r\n  = ()\n\n\nlet or_elim_sugar #p #q #r\n                  (pf_p:squash (p \\/ q))\n                  (pf_pr:unit -> Lemma (requires p) (ensures r))\n                  (pf_qr:unit -> Lemma (requires q) (ensures r))\n  : squash r\n  = eliminate p \\/ q\n    returns r\n    with pf_p. pf_pr () //pf_p : squash p\n    and  pf_q. pf_qr () //pf_q : squash q\n\n\nOne of the elimination principles for disjunction used the implication\nconnective ==> . Its definition is shown below:\n\nlet ( ==> ) (p q : Type) = squash (p -> q)\n\n\nThat is, ==> is just the squashed version of the non-dependent\narrow type -> .\n\nNote\n\nIn Prims , the definition of p ==> q is actually squash (p -> GTot q) , a ghost function from p to q . We’ll learn\nabout this more when we encounter effects.\n\nIntroducing a constructive arrow p -> q just involves constructing\na λ -literal of the appropriate type.\n\nOne can turn several kinds of arrows into implications, as shown below.\n\nOne option is to directly use a function from the FStar.Classical library, as shown below:\n\nval impl_intro_tot (#p #q: Type) (f: (p -> q)) : (p ==> q)\n\n\nHowever, this form is seldom used in F*. Instead, one often works with\nfunctions between squashed propositions, or Lemmas, turning them into\nimplications when needed. We show a few styles below.\n\nlet implies_intro_1 #p #q (pq: squash p -> squash q)\n  : squash (p ==> q)\n  = introduce p ==> q\n    with pf_p. pq pf_p\n\nlet implies_intro_2 #p #q (pq: unit -> Lemma (requires p) (ensures\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_994e5b5e71befdf12c2acbfa17f1a4f95016ba1ff7723f42174c6197acc01a02_v2"}

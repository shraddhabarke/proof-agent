For instance, there are several\ntypes for the function let incr = (fun (x:int) -> x + 1) : val incr : int -> int val incr : x : int -> y : int { y > x } val incr : x : int -> y : int { y = x + 1 } The first type int -> int is its traditional type in languages\nlike OCaml. The second type x:int -> y:int{y > x} states that the returned\nvalue y is greater than the argument x . The third type is the most precise: x:int -> y:int{y = x + 1} states that the result y is exactly the increment of the\nargument x .\n\nval incr : int -> int\nval incr : x:int -> y:int{y > x}\nval incr : x:int -> y:int{y = x + 1}\n\n\n- It’s often convenient to add refinements on arguments in a\ndependent function type. For instance: val f : x :( x : int { x >= 1 }) -> y :( y : int { y > x }) -> z : int { z > x + y } Since this style is so common, and it is inconvenient to have to\nbind two names for the parameters x and y , F* allows (and\nencourages) you to write: val f : x : int { x >= 1 } -> y : int { y > x } -> z : int { z > x + y }\n\nval f : x:(x:int{ x >= 1 }) -> y:(y:int{ y > x }) -> z:int{ z > x + y }\n\n\nval f : x:int{ x >= 1 } -> y:int{ y > x } -> z:int{ z > x + y }\n\n\n- To emphasize that functions in F*’s core are total functions (i.e.,\nthey always return a result), we sometimes annotate the result type\nwith the effect label “ Tot ”. This label is optional, but\nespecially as we learn about effects , emphasizing\nthat some functions have no effects via the Tot label is\nuseful. For example, one might sometimes write: val f : x : int { x >= 1 } -> y : int { y > x } -> Tot ( z : int { z > x + y }) adding a Tot annotation on the last arrow, to indicate that the\nfunction has no side effects. One could also write: val f : x : int { x >= 1 } -> Tot ( y : int { y > x } -> Tot ( z : int { z > x + y })) adding an annotation on the intermediate arrow, though this is not\ncustomary.\n\nval f : x:int{ x >= 1 } -> y:int{ y > x } -> Tot (z:int{ z > x + y })\n\n\nval f : x:int{ x >= 1 } -> Tot (y:int{ y > x } -> Tot (z:int{ z > x + y }))\n\n\nThis first example is just to show you how to run the tool and\ninterpret its output.\n\nmodule Part1.GettingOffTheGround\n\nlet incr (x:int) : int = x + 1\n\n\nNotice that the program begins with a module declaration. It\ncontains a single definition named incr . Definitions that appear\nat the scope of a module are called “top-level” definitions.\n\nYou have several options to try out these examples.\n\nF* online\n\nTo get started and for trying small exercises, the easiest way is via\nthe online tutorial . If that’s\nwhere you’re reading this, you can just use the in-browser editor\nalongside which communicates with an F* instance running in the\ncloud. Just click on this link to load the\ncode of an exercise in the editor.\n\nThat said, the online mode can be a bit slow, depending on the load at\nthe server, and the editor is very minimalistic.\n\nFor anything more than small exercises, you should have a working\nlocal installation of the F* toolchain, as described next.\n\nF* in batch mode\n\nYou can download pre-built F* binaries from here .\n\nOnce you have a local installation, to check a program you can run the fstar at the command line, like so:\n\n$ fstar Sample.fst\n\n\nIn response fstar should output:\n\nVerified module: Sample\nAll verification conditions discharged successfully\n\n\nThis means that F* attempted to verify the module named Sample . In\ndoing so, it generated a some “verification conditions”, or proof\nobligations, necessary to prove that the module is type correct, and\nthat is discharged, or proved, all of them successfully.\n\nF* in emacs\n\nRather than running fstar in batch mode from the command line, F*\nprogrammers using the emacs editor often use fstar-mode.el , an editor plugin that\nallows interactively checking an F* program. If you plan to use F* in\nany serious way, this is strongly recommended.\n\nHere are some types for incr , including some types that are valid\nand some others that are not.\n\nThis type claims that incr result is\ngreater than its argument and F* agrees—remember, the int type is\nunbounded, so there’s no danger of the addition overflowing.\n\nlet incr1 (x:int) : y:int{y > x} = x + 1\n\n\nThis type claims that incr always returns a natural number, but it\nisn’t true, since incrementing a negative\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>F*<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A programming language designed for program verification that allows expressing precise specifications about programs, including functional correctness and absence of side effects)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INCR<|>EVENT<|>A function in F* that increments its integer argument by 1, showcasing the use of dependent types for specifying function behavior)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MODULE PART1.GETTINGOFFTHEGROUND<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A module in F* containing the definition of the incr function, illustrating basic usage of the language)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INCR<|>F*<|>The incr function is an example used to demonstrate the capabilities and syntax of the F* programming language<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MODULE PART1.GETTINGOFFTHEGROUND<|>INCR<|>The incr function is a top-level definition within the Module Part1.GettingOffTheGround, showing how functions are defined and used in F*<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

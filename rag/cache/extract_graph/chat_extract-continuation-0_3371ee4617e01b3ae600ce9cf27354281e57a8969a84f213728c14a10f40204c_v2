This\nis necessary if you want to understand a bit about how F* infers\nthe logical constraints needed to prove the correctness of a\nprogram. It is also useful background for more advanced material in\nsubsequent chapters about defining custom effects in F*, e.g.,\neffects to model state, exceptions, or concurrency.\n\nRefinement types x:t{p} refine value types t and allow us to\nmake more precise assertions about the values in the program. For\nexample, when we have v : x:int{x >= 0} , then not only we know\nthat v is an int , but also that v >= 0 .\n\nIn a similar manner, F* allows refining computation types with\nspecifications that describe some aspects of a program’s computational\nbehavior. These effect refinements can, in general, be defined by\nthe user in a reasoning system of their choosing, e.g., the\nrefinements may use separation logic, or they may count computation\nsteps.\n\nHowever, F* has built-in support for refining the specification of\npure programs with effect refinements that encode the standard\nreasoning principles of Floyd-Hoare Logic and weakest\nprecondition-based calculi. Foreshadowing what’s about to come in this\nchapter, we can write the following specification for the factorial function:\n\nopen FStar.Mul\nlet rec factorial (x:int)\n  : Pure int (requires x >= 0) (ensures fun r -> r >= 1)\n  = if x = 0\n    then 1\n    else x * factorial (x - 1)\n\n\nIntuitively, this type states that factorial x is a computation\ndefined only when x >= 0 and always terminates returning a value r >= 1 . In a way, this type is closely related to other, more\nfamiliar, types we have given to factorial so far, e.g., nat -> pos , and, indeed, factorial can be used at this type.\n\nlet fact (x:nat) : pos = factorial x\n\n\nActually, in all the code we’ve seen so far, what’s happening under\nthe covers is that F* infers a type for a pure program similar to Pure t pre post and then checks that that type can be subsumed to\na user-provided specification of the form Tot t' .\n\nIn this chapter, we look into how these Pure specifications work,\nstarting with a primer on Floyd-Hoare Logic and weakest precondition\ncalculi. If the reader is familiar with these, they may safely skip\nthe next subsections, though even if you are an expert, if may be of\ninterest to see how such program logics can be formalized in F*.\n\nFloyd-Hoare Logic is a system of specifications and rules to reason\nabout the logical properties of programs, introduced by Robert Floyd\nin a paper titled Assigning Meaning to Programs and\nby Tony Hoare in An axiomatic basis for computer programming . The notation used in\nmost modern presentations (called Hoare triples) is due to Hoare.  An\nalgorithm to compute Hoare triples was developed by Edsger Dijkstra presented first in this paper , using a\ntechnique called weakest preconditions . All of them received Turing\nAwards for their work on these and other related topics.\n\nFor an introduction to these ideas, we’ll develop a small imperative\nlanguage with global variables, presenting\n\n- An operational semantics for the language, formalized as an\ninterpreter.\n\n- A Floyd-Hoare program logic proven sound with respect to the\noperational semantics.\n\n- And, finally, an algorithm to compute weakest preconditions proved\nsound against the Floyd-Hoare logic.\n\nOur language has the following abstract syntax:\n\nlet var = nat\n\ntype expr =\n  | EConst : int -> expr                           // constants: ..., -1, 0, 1, ...\n  | EVar   : var -> expr                           // global variables\n  | EAdd   : expr -> expr -> expr                  // arithmetic: e1 + e2\n  \ntype program = \n  | Assign : var -> expr -> program                // x := e\n  | Seq    : program -> program -> program         // p1; p2\n  | If     : expr -> program -> program -> program // if e then p1 else p2\n  | Repeat : expr -> program -> program            // repeat n { p }\n\n\nExpressions includes integer constants, global variables (represented\njust as natural numbers), and some other forms, e.g., arithmetic\nexpressions like addition.\n\nA program includes:\n\n- Assignments, EAssign x e , representing the assignment of the\nresult of an expression e to a global variable x , i.e., x := e\n\n- Seq , to compose programs sequentially\n\n- If to compose programs conditionally\n\n- And Repeat n p , which represents a construct similar to a for -loop (or primitive recursion), where the program p is\nrepeated n times, where n evaluates to a non-negative\ninteger.\n\nOur language does not have while loops, whose semantics are a bit\nmore subtle to develop. We will look at a semantics for while in a\nsubsequent chapter.\n\nOur first step in giving a semantics to programs is to define an\ninterpreter for it to run a program while transforming a memory that\nstores the values of the global variables.\n\nTo model this memory, we use the type state shown below:\n\n// The state of a program is a map from global variable to integers\nlet state = var -> int\nlet read (s:state) (i:var) : int = s i\nlet write (s:state) (i:var) (v:int\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>FLOYD-HOARE LOGIC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A system of specifications and rules to reason about the logical properties of programs, introduced by Robert Floyd and Tony Hoare)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>F*<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A programming language that infers logical constraints needed to prove the correctness of a program and allows defining custom effects to model various computational behaviors)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROBERT FLOYD<|>PERSON<|>Co-introducer of Floyd-Hoare Logic, which is a foundational concept in computer science for reasoning about program correctness)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TONY HOARE<|>PERSON<|>Co-introducer of Floyd-Hoare Logic and developer of the notation used in most modern presentations of Hoare triples)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EDSGER DIJKSTRA<|>PERSON<|>Developed an algorithm to compute Hoare triples using a technique called weakest preconditions)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FLOYD-HOARE LOGIC<|>ROBERT FLOYD<|>Robert Floyd co-introduced Floyd-Hoare Logic<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FLOYD-HOARE LOGIC<|>TONY HOARE<|>Tony Hoare co-introduced Floyd-Hoare Logic and contributed to its notation<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FLOYD-HOARE LOGIC<|>EDSGER DIJKSTRA<|>Edsger Dijkstra's work on weakest preconditions is a fundamental part of Floyd-Hoare Logic<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>F*<|>FLOYD-HOARE LOGIC<|>F* uses principles of Floyd-Hoare Logic for refining the specification of pure programs<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

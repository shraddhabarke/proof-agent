We call\nthis “squashing” a type. This is so common, that F* provides two\nmechanisms to support this:\n\n- All the propositional connectives, like p /\\ q are designed so\nthat both p and q can be types (i.e., p,q : Type ),\nrather than propositions, and they implicitly squash their types.\n\n- The standard library, FStar.Squash , provides several utilities\nfor manipulating squashed types.\n\nNow that we have a way to write down propositions, how can we ask F*\nto check if those propositions are valid? There are several ways, the\nmost common of which is an assertion . Here’s an example:\n\nlet sqr_is_nat (x:int) : unit = assert (x * x >= 0)\n\n\nThis defines a function sqr_is_nat : int -> unit —meaning it takes\na nat and always returns () . So, it’s not very interesting as\na function.\n\nHowever, it’s body contains an assertion that x * x >= 0 . Now,\nmany programming languages support runtime assertions—code to check\nsome property of program when it executes. But, assertions in F* are\ndifferent—they are checked by the F* compiler before your program is\nexecuted.\n\nIn this case, the assert instructs F* to encode the program to SMT\nand to ask Z3 if x * x >= 0 is valid for an arbitrary integer x:int . If Z3 can confirm this fact (which it can), then F* accepts\nthe program and no trace of the assertion is left in your program when\nit executes. Otherwise the program is rejected at compile time. For\nexample, if we were to write\n\nlet sqr_is_pos (x:int) : unit = assert (x * x > 0)\n\n\nThen, F* complains with the following message:\n\nCh2.fst(5,39-5,50): (Error 19) assertion failed; The SMT solver could not prove the query, try to spell your proof in more detail or increase fuel/ifuel\n\n\nYou can use an assertion with any proposition, as shown below.\n\nlet max x y = if x > y then x else y\nlet _ = assert (max 0 1 = 1)\nlet _ = assert (forall x y. max x y >= x /\\\n                            max x y >= y /\\\n                            (max x y = x \\/ max x y = y))\n\n\nThe dual of an assertion is an assumption. Rather than asking F* and\nZ3 to prove a fact, an assumption allows one to tell F* and Z3 to\naccept that some proposition is valid. You should use assumptions with\ncare—it’s easy to make a mistake and assume a fact that isn’t actually\ntrue.\n\nThe syntax of an assumption is similar to an assertion. Here, below,\nwe write assume (x <> 0) to tell F* to assume x is non-zero in\nthe rest of the function. That allows F* to prove that the assertion\nthat follows is valid.\n\nlet sqr_is_pos (x:int) = assume (x <> 0); assert (x * x > 0)\n\n\nOf course, the assertion is not valid for all x —it’s only valid\nfor those x that also validate the preceding assumption.\n\nJust like an assert , the type of assume p is unit .\n\nThere’s a more powerful form of assumption, called an admit . The\nterm admit() can given any type you like. For example,\n\nlet sqr_is_pos (x:int) : y:nat{y > 0} = admit()\n\n\nBoth assume and admit can be helpful when you’re working\nthrough a proof, but a proof isn’t done until it’s free of them.\n\n© Copyright 2020, Microsoft Research.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>F*<|>ORGANIZATION<|>F* is a programming language designed for program verification that supports assertions and assumptions to check propositions before program execution)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Z3<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Z3 is an SMT solver used by F* to verify assertions in programs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FSTAR.SQUASH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>FStar.Squash is a standard library in F* that provides utilities for manipulating squashed types)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>F*<|>Z3<|>F* uses Z3 to verify the validity of assertions in programs<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>F*<|>FSTAR.SQUASH<|>FStar.Squash is a part of F*'s standard library providing support for squashed types<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

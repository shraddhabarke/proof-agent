To apply the substitution\n  ``s`` to the body ``e1``, we have to traverse a binder. The mutally\n  recursive function ``sub_elam0 s`` adjusts ``s`` to account for this\n  new binder, which has de Bruijn index ``0`` in the body ``e1`` (at\n  least until another binder is encountered).\n\n  - In ``sub_elam0``, if we are applying ``s`` to the newly bound\n    variable at index ``0``, then we leave that variable unchanged,\n    since ``s`` cannot affect it.\n\n  - Otherwise, we have a variable with index at least ``1``,\n    referencing a binder that is bound in an outer scope; so, we shift\n    it down and apply ``s`` to it, and then increment all the\n    variables in the resulting term (using ``sub_inc0``) to avoid capture.\n\nThis definition of substitution is correct, but F* refuses to accept\nit since we have not convinced the typechecker that ``subst0`` and\n``sub_elam0`` actually terminate. In fact, F* complains in two\nlocations about a failed termination check.\n\n.. note::\n\n   This definition is expected to fail, so the ``[@@expect_failure\n   [19;19]]`` attribute on the definition asks F* to check that the\n   definition raises Error 19 twice. We'll look in detail as to why it\n   fails, next.\n\nSubstitution, Proven Total\n--------------------------\n\nInformally, let's try to convince ourselves why ``subst0`` and\n``sub_elam0`` actually terminate.\n\n* The recursive calls in the ``EApp`` case are applied to strictly\n  smaller sub-terms (``e0`` and ``e1``) of the original term ``e``.\n\n* In the ``ELam`` case, we apply ``subst0`` to a smaller sub-term\n  ``e1``, but we make a mutally recursive call to ``sub_elam0 s``\n  first---so we need to check that that call terminates. This is the\n  first place where F* complains.\n\n* When calling ``sub_elam0``, it calls back to ``subst0`` on a\n  completely unrelated term ``s (y - 1)``, and F* complains that this\n  may not terminate. But, thankfully, this call makes use only of the\n  ``sub_inc0`` substitution, which is just a renaming substitution and\n  which does not make any further recursive calls. Somehow, we have to\n  convince F* that a recursive call with a renaming substitution is\n  fine.\n\nTo distinguish renamings from general substitutions, we'll use an\nindexed type ``sub r``, shown below.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Part2.STLC.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: sub$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: sub$\n\n* ``sub true`` is the type of renamings, substitutions that map\n  variables to variables.\n\n* ``sub false`` are substitutions that map at least one variable to a\n  non-variable.\n\nIt's easy to prove that ``sub_inc`` is a renaming:\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Part2.STLC.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: sub_inc$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: sub_inc$\n\nThe function ``sub_beta`` shown below is the analog of ``sub_beta0``,\nbut with a type that tracks whether it is a renaming or not.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Part2.STLC.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: sub_beta$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: sub_beta$\n\n* The type says that ``sub_beta e`` is a renaming if and only if ``e``\n  is itself a variable.\n\n* Proving this type, particularly in the case where ``e`` is not a\n  variable requires proving an existentially quantified formula, i.e.,\n  ``exists x. ~(EVar (subst_beta e) x)``. As mentioned\n  :ref:`previously <Part2_connectives_exists>`, the SMT solver cannot\n  always automatically instantiate existential quantifiers in the\n  goal. So, we introduce the existential quantifier explicitly,\n  providing the witness ``0``, and then the SMT solver can easily\n  prove ``~(EVar (subst_beta e) 0)``.\n\nFinally, we show the definitions of ``subst`` and ``sub_elam``\nbelow---identical to ``subst0`` and ``sub_elam0``, but enriched with\ntypes that allow expressing a termination argument to F* using a\n4-ary lexicographic ordering.\n\n.. literal\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>EUNIT<|>EVENT<|>A case in the substitution function where there are no variables to substitute)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EVAR<|>EVENT<|>A case in the substitution function where the substitution is applied directly to a variable)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EAPP<|>EVENT<|>A case in the substitution function where the substitution is applied to each sub-term of an application)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ELAM<|>EVENT<|>A case in the substitution function involving a lambda expression where the substitution has to account for a new binder)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUBST<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Function that applies a substitution to an expression)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUB_ELAM0<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Mutually recursive function with subst that adjusts the substitution for a new binder)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUB_INC0<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Function that increments all variables in a term to avoid capture)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUB_BETA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Function analogous to sub_beta0 but with a type tracking whether it is a renaming or not)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ELAM<|>SUB_ELAM0<|>ELam case involves calling sub_elam0 to adjust the substitution for a new binder<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SUB_ELAM0<|>SUBST<|>Sub_elam0 makes a call back to subst on a term, indicating a mutual recursion<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SUBST<|>EAPP<|>Subst applies the substitution to each sub-term in the EApp case<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SUBST<|>EVAR<|>Subst applies the substitution directly to a variable in the EVar case<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SUBST<|>EUNIT<|>Subst finds no variables to substitute in the EUnit case, making it trivial<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SUB_INC0<|>SUBST<|>Sub_inc0 is used within subst to increment variables and avoid capture<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SUB_BETA<|>SUBST<|>Sub_beta is an analog of subst that tracks if it is a renaming or not<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

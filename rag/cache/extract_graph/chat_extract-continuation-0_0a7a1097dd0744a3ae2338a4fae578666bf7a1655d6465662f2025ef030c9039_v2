This is contrast with ``bool``,\nthe type of booleans ``{true, false}``. Clearly, one could not define\n``halts tm`` as a ``bool``, since one would be claiming that for\n``halts`` is function that for any ``tm`` can decide (by returning\ntrue or false) whether or not ``tm`` halts on all inputs.\n\nF* will implicitly convert a ``bool`` to a ``prop`` when needed, since\na decidable fact can be turned into a fact that may be\nundecidable. But, when using propositions, one can define things that\ncannot be defined in ``bool``, including quantified formulae, as we'll\nsee next.\n\n.. _Part1_prop_connectives:\n\nPropositional connectives\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nConsider stating that ``factorial n`` always returns a positive\nnumber, when ``n:nat``. In the :ref:`previous section <Part1_ch1>` we\nlearned that one way to do this is to give ``factorial`` a type like so.\n\n.. code-block:: fstar\n\n  val factorial (n:nat) : x:nat{x > 0}\n\nHere's another way to state it:\n\n.. code-block:: fstar\n                \n  forall (n:nat). factorial n > 0\n\nWhat about stating that ``factorial n`` can sometimes return a value\nthat's greater than ``n * n``?\n\n.. code-block:: fstar\n                \n  exists (n:nat). factorial n > n * n\n  \nWe've just seen our first use of universal and existential\nquantifiers.\n\nQuantifiers\n...........\n\nA universal quantifier is constructed using the ``forall`` keyword. Its\nsyntax has the following shape.\n\n.. code-block:: fstar\n                \n  forall (x1:t1) ... (xn:tn) . p\n\nThe ``x1 ... xn`` are bound variables and signify the domain over\nwhich one the proposition ``p`` is quantified. That is, ``forall\n(x:t). p`` is valid when for all ``v : t`` the proposition ``p[v/x]``\nis valid.\n\nAnd existential quantifier has similar syntax, using the ``exists``\nkeyword.\n\n.. code-block:: fstar\n                \n   exists (x1:t1) ... (xn:tn) . p\n\nIn this case, ``exists (x:t). p`` is valid when for some ``v : t`` the\nproposition ``p[v/x]`` is valid.\n\nThe scope of a quantifier extends as far to the right as possible.\n\nAs usual in F*, the types on the bound variables can be omitted and F*\nwill infer them. However, in the case of quantified formulas, it's a\ngood idea to write down the types, since the meaning of the quantifier\ncan change significantly depending on the type of the variable. Consider\nthe two propositions below.\n\n.. code-block:: fstar\n\n   exists (x:int). x < 0\n   exists (x:nat). x < 0\n\nThe first formula is valid by considering ``x = -1``, while the second\none is not—there is not natural number less than zero.\n\nIt is possible to quantify over any F* type. This makes the\nquantifiers higher order and dependent. For example, one can write\n\n.. code-block:: fstar\n\n   forall (n:nat) (p: (x:nat{x >= n} -> prop)). p n \n\n.. note::\n\n   The SMT solver uses a number of heuristics to determine if a\n   quantified proposition is valid. As you start writing more\n   substantial F* programs and proofs, it will become important to\n   learn a bit about these heuristics. We'll cover this in a later\n   chapter. If you're impatient, you can also read about in on the `F*\n   wiki\n   <https://github.com/FStarLang/FStar/wiki/Quantifiers-and-patterns>`_.\n   \n\nConjunction, Disjunction, Negation, Implication\n...............................................\n\nIn addition to the quantifiers, you can build propositions by\ncombining them with other propositions, using the operators below, in\ndecreasing order of precedence.\n\n**Negation**\n\nThe proposition ``~p`` is valid if the negation of ``p`` is\nvalid. This is similar to the boolean operator ``not``, but applies to\npropositions rather than just booleans.\n\n**Conjunction**\n\nThe proposition ``p /\\ q`` is valid if both ``p`` and ``q`` are\nvalid. This is similar to the boolean operator ``&&``, but applies to\npropositions rather than just booleans.\n\n**Disjunction**\n\nThe proposition ``p \\/ q`` is valid if at least one of ``p`` and ``q``\nare valid. This is similar to the boolean operator ``||``, but applies\nto propositions rather than just booleans.\n\n**Implication**\n\nThe proposition ``p ==> q`` is valid if whenever ``p`` is valid, ``q``\nis also valid.\n\n**Double Implication**\n\nThe proposition ``p <==> q`` is valid if ``p`` and ``q`` are\nequivalent.\n\n.. note::\n\n   This may come as a surprise, but these precedence rules mean that\n   ``p /\\ q ==> r`` is parsed as ``(p /\\ q) ==> r`` rather than\n   ``p /\\ (q ==> r)``. When in doubt, use parentheses.\n\n\nAtomic propositions\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nWe've shown you how to form new propositions by building them from\nexisting propositions using the connectives.

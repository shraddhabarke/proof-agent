    (v:option a)\n: vprop\n= match x, v with\n  | None, None -> emp\n  | Some x, Some w -> pts_to x #p w\n  | _ -> pure False\n\n\nThis could also work, though it would require handling an additional\n(impossible) case.\n\nLet’s try our first pattern match in Pulse:\n\nfn read_nullable #a #p (r:nullable_ref a)\nrequires pts_to_or_null r #p 'v\nreturns o:option a\nensures pts_to_or_null r #p 'v\n        ** pure ('v == o)\n{\n    match r {\n     Some x -> {\n        rewrite each r as (Some x);\n        unfold (pts_to_or_null (Some x) #p 'v);\n        let o = !x;\n        fold (pts_to_or_null (Some x) #p 'v);\n        rewrite each (Some x) as r;\n        Some o\n     }\n     None -> {\n        rewrite each r as None;\n        unfold (pts_to_or_null None #p 'v);\n        fold (pts_to_or_null None #p 'v);\n        rewrite each (None #(ref a)) as r;\n        None #a\n     }\n    }\n}\n\n\nThe syntax of pattern matching in Pulse is more imperative and\nRust-like than what F* uses.\n\n- The entire body of match is enclosed within braces\n\n- Each branch is also enclosed within braces.\n\n- Pulse (for now) only supports simple patterns with a single top-level\nconstructor applied to variables, or variable patterns: e.g., you\ncannot write Some (Some x) as a pattern.\n\nThe type of read_nullable promises to return a value equal to the\nlogical witness of its representation predicate.\n\nThe code is a little tedious—we’ll see how to clean it up a bit\nshortly.\n\nA show_proof_state in the Some x branch prints the following:\n\n- Current context:\n    pts_to_or_null r (reveal 'v)\n- In typing environment:\n    [branch equality#684 : squash (eq2 r (Some x)),\n     ...\n\n\nThe interesting part is the branch equality hypothesis, meaning\nthat in this branch, we can assume that (r == Some x) . So, the\nfirst thing we do is to rewrite r ; then we unfold the\nrepresentation predicate; read the value o out of x ; fold the\npredicate back; rewrite in the other direction; and return Some o . The None case is similar.\n\nAnother difference between Pulse and F* matches is that Pulse does not\nprovide any negated path conditions. For example, in the example\nbelow, the assertion fails, since the pattern is only a wildcard and\nthe Pulse checker does not prove not (Some? x) as the path\ncondition hypothesis for the preceding branches not taken.\n\n[@@expect_failure]\n```pulse\nfn read_nullable_alt #a #p (r:nullable_ref a)\nrequires pts_to_or_null r #p 'v\nreturns o:option a\nensures emp\n{\n    match r {\n     Some x -> { admit () }\n     _ -> { \n        // we only have `r == _` in scope\n        // not the negation of the prior branch conditions\n        // i.e., unlike F*, we don't have not (Some? r)\n        // so the assertion below fails\n        assert (pure (r == None)); \n        admit() }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n\nWe plan to enhance the Pulse checker to also provide these negated\npath conditions.\n\nWhen a vprop is defined by cases (like pts_to_or_null ) it is\nvery common to have to reason according to those cases when pattern\nmatching. Instead of rewriting, unfolding, folding, and rewriting\nevery time, one can define helper functions to handle these cases.\n\n```pulse\nghost\nfn elim_pts_to_or_null_none #a #p (r:nullable_ref a)\nrequires pts_to_or_null r #p 'v ** pure (r == None)\nensures pts_to_or_null r #p 'v ** pure ('v == None)\n{\n    rewrite each r as None;\n    unfold (pts_to_or_null None #p 'v);\n    fold (pts_to_or_null None #p 'v);\n    rewrite each (None #(ref a)) as r;\n}\n```\n\n```pulse\nghost\nfn intro_pts_to_or_null_none #a #p (r:nullable_ref a)\nrequires pure (r == None)\nensures pts_to_or_null r #p None\n{\n    fold (pts_to_or_null #a None #p None);\n    rewrite each (None #(ref a)) as r;\n}\n```\n\n```pulse\nghost\nfn elim_pts_to_or_null_some #a #p (r:nullable_ref a) (x:ref a)\nrequires pts_to_or_null r #p 'v ** pure (r == Some x)\nensures exists* w. pts_to x #p w ** pure ('v == Some w)\n{\n    rewrite each r as (Some x);\n    unfold (pts_to_or_null (Some x) #p 'v);\n}\n```\n\n```pulse\nghost\nfn intro_pts_to_or_null_some #a #p (r:nullable_ref a) (x:ref a)\nrequires pts_to x #p 'v ** pure (r == Some x)\nensures pts_to_or_null r #p (Some 'v)\n{\n    fold (pts_to_or_null (Some x) #p (Some 'v));\n    rewrite each (Some x) as r;\n}\n```\n\n\nThese functions are all marked ghost , indicating that they are\npurely for proof purposes only.\n\nWriting these helpers is often quite mechanical:\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_fcea315ab85130d6cbd289cff12a6841f78892863f124ed288d124970365930d_v2"}

If you’re\nviewing this in the interactive online tutorial, you can use the Ace-based text editor alongside, which\nprovides some basic conveniences like syntax highlighting. However,\nbeyond casual use, most users of F* rely on one of the follwing IDE\nplugins.\n\n- fstar-mode.el ,\nwhich provides several utilities for interactively editing and\nchecking F* files in emacs.\n\n- fstar-vscode-assistant , which\nalso provides interactive editing and checking support in VS Code.\n\nThe main benefit to using these IDE plugins is that they allow you to\nincrementally check just the changing suffix of an F* file, rather\nthan rechecking the entire file in batch mode. They also provide\nstandard things like jumping to definitions, type of a symbol etc.\n\nBoth these plugins rely on a generic but custom interaction protocol\nimplemented by the F* compiler. It should be possible to implement IDE\nsupport similar to fstar-mode.el or fstar-vscode-assistant in your\nfavorite plugin-capable editor.\n\nAn F* program is a collection of modules, with each\nmodule represented by a single file with the filename extension .fst . Later, we’ll see that a module’s interface is in a separate .fsti file and allows hiding details of a module’s implementation\nfrom a client module.\n\nA module begins with the module’s name (which must match the name of\nits file, i.e., module A is in A.fst ) and contains a sequence\nof top-level signatures and definitions. Module names always begin\nwith a capital letter.\n\n- Signatures ascribe a type to a definition, e.g., val f : t .\n\nDefinitions come in several flavors: the two main forms we’ll focus on\nwhen programming with total functions are\n\n- possibly recursive definitions (let bindings, let [rec] f = e )\n\n- and, inductive type definitions (datatypes, type t = | D1 : t1 | ... | Dn : tn )\n\nIn later sections, we’ll see two other kinds of definition:\nuser-defined indexed effects and sub-effects.\n\nBlock comments are delimited by (* and *) . Line comments begin\nwith // .\n\n(* this is a\n   block comment *)\n\n\n//This is a line comment\n\n\nEvery F* program is checked in the context of some ambient primitive\ndefinitions taken from the core F* module Prims .\n\nThe type False has no elements. Since there are no terms that\nsatisfy e : False , the type False is the type of unprovable\npropositions.\n\nThe type unit has a single element denoted () , i.e., () : unit .\n\nThe type bool has two elements, true and false . Note, the\nlowercase false is a boolean constant, distinct from the uppercase False type.\n\nThe following primitive boolean operators are available, in decreasing\norder of precedence.\n\n- not : Boolean negation (unary, prefix)\n\n- && : Boolean conjunction (binary, infix)\n\n- || : Boolean disjunction (binary, infix)\n\nYou can, of course, branch on a boolean with if/then/else\n\nif b then 1 else 0\n\nif b1 && b2 || b3\nthen 17\nelse 42\n\n\nThe type int represents unbounded, primitive mathematical\nintegers. Its elements are formed from the literals 0, 1, 2, ... ,\nand the following primitive operators, in decreasing order of\nprecedence.\n\n- - : Unary negation (prefix)\n\n- - : Subtraction (infix)\n\n- + : Addition (infix)\n\n- / : Euclidean division (infix)\n\n- % : Euclidean modulus (infix)\n\n- op_Multiply : Unfortunately, the traditional multiplication\nsymbol * is reserved by default for the tuple type\nconstructor. Use the module FStar.Mul to treat * as integer\nmultiplication.\n\n- < : Less than (infix)\n\n- <= : Less than or equal (infix)\n\n- > : Greater than (infix)\n\n- >= : Greater than or equal (infix)\n\nNote\n\nF* follows the OCaml style of no negative integer literals,\ninstead negate a positive integer like (- 1) .\n\nThe F* core library, Prims , defines the type of\nnatural numbers as follows\n\nlet nat = x:int{x >= 0}\n\n\nThis is an instance of a boolean refinement type, whose general form\nis x:t { e } where t is a type, and e is a bool -typed term\nthat may refer to the t -typed bound variable x . The term e refines the type t , in the sense that the set S denoted by t is restricted to those elements x ∈ S for which e evaluates to true .\n\nThat is, the type nat describes the set of terms that evaluate to an\nelement of the set {0, 1, 2, 3, ...} .\n\nBut, there’s nothing particularly special about nat . You can define\narbitrary refinements of your choosing, e.g.,\n\nlet empty = x:int { false } //the empty set\nlet zero = x:int{ x = 0 } //the type containing one element `0`\nlet pos = x:int { x > 0 } //the positive numbers\nlet neg = x:int { x < 0 } //the negative numbers\nlet even = x:int { x % 2 = 0 } //the even numbers\nlet odd = x:int { x % 2 = 1 } //the odd numbers\n\n\nIf you’re coming from a language like C or Java where a type primarily\ndes\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>F*<|>ORGANIZATION<|>F* is a programming language with a focus on the syntax of the language and core concepts of types and functions.

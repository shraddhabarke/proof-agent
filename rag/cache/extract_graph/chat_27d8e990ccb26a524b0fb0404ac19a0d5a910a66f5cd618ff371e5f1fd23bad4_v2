In the second case,\njust as with our vector examples, F* accepts ``Reflexivity #_ #6`` as\nhaving type ``equals (factorial 3) 6``, since ``equals 6 6`` is\ndefinitionally equal to ``equals (factorial 3) 6``.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/ProvableEquality.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: sample_equals_proofs$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: sample_equals_proofs$\n\nAlthough the only constructor of ``equals`` is ``Reflexivity``, as the\nthe following code shows, ``equals`` is actually an equivalence\nrelation, satisfying (in addition to reflexivity) the laws of symmetry\nand transitivity.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/ProvableEquality.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: equivalence_relation$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: equivalence_relation$\n\nThis might seem like magic: how is it is that we can derive symmetry\nand transitivity from reflexivity alone? The answer lies in how F*\ninterprets inductive type definitions.\n\nIn particular, given an inductive type definition of type\n:math:`T~\\overline{p}`, where :math:`\\overline{p}` is a list of\nparameters and, F* includes an axiom stating that any value :math:`v:\nT~\\overline{p}` must be an application of one of the constructors of\n:math:`T`, :math:`D~\\overline{v} : T~\\overline{p'}`, such that\n:math:`\\overline{p} = \\overline{p'}`.\n\nIn the case of equality proofs, this allows F* to conclude that every\nequality proof is actually an instance of ``Reflexivity``, as shown\nbelow.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/ProvableEquality.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: uip_refl$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: uip_refl$\n\nSpend a minute looking at the statement above: the return type is a\nstatement of equality about equality proofs.

The property below is\nknown as the *uniqueness of identity proofs* (UIP) and is at the core\nof what makes F* an extensional type theory.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/ProvableEquality.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: uip$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: uip$\n\nThe F* module ``Prims``, the very first module in every program's\ndependence graph, defines the ``equals`` type as shown here. The\nprovable equality predicate ``(==)`` that we've used in several\nexamples already is just a squashed equality proof, as shown below.\n\n.. code-block:: fstar\n\n   let ( == ) #a (x y : a) = squash (equals x y)\n\nIn what follows, we'll mostly use squashed equalities, except where we\nwish to emphasize the reflexivity proofs.\n\nEquality Reflection\n...................\n\nWhat makes F* an *extensional* type theory (and unlike the\n*intensional* type theories implemented by Coq, Lean, Agda, etc.) is a\nfeature known as equality reflection. Whereas intensional type\ntheories treat definitional and provable equalities separate, in F*\nterms that are provably equal are also considered definitionally\nequal. That is, if in a given context ``x == y`` is derivable, the\n``x`` is also definitionally equal to ``y``. This has some\nwide-reaching consequences.\n\nImplicit conversions using provable equalities\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nRecall from the start of the chapter that ``v:vec a ((fun x -> x) 0)``\nis implicitly convertible to the type ``vec a 0``, since the two types\nare related by congruence and reduction. However, as the examples\nbelow show, if ``a == b`` is derivable in the context, then\n``v:a`` can be implicity converted to the type ``b``.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/ProvableEquality.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: conversion_with_equality_proofs$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: conversion_with_equality_proofs$\n\nWe do not require a proof of ``a == b`` to be literally bound in the\ncontext. As the example below shows, the hypothesis ``h`` is used in\nconjunction with the control flow of the program to prove that in the\n``then`` branch ``aa : int`` and in the ``else`` branch ``bb\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_27d8e990ccb26a524b0fb0404ac19a0d5a910a66f5cd618ff371e5f1fd23bad4_v2"}

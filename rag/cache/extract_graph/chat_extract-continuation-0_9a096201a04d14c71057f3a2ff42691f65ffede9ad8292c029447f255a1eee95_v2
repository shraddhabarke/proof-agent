For pure programs this may seem like overkill, since the\npure term itself can be reasoned about directly, but when the term\ncontains non-trivial typing constraints, e.g., such as those that\narise from refinement type checking, lifting the entire program into a\nsingle constraint structures and simplifies logical reasoning.\n\nOf course, one often writes specifications that are more abstract than\nthe full logical lifting of the program, as in the example below,\nwhich says that to prove post of the return value, the\nprecondition is to prove post on all y >= x . This is a\nvalid, although weaker, characterization of the function’s return\nvalue.\n\nlet maybe_incr2 (b:bool) (x:int)\n  : PURE int (as_pure_wp (fun post -> forall (y:int). y >= x ==> post y))\n  = if b\n    then let y = x + 1 in y\n    else x\n\n\nThe PURE computation type comes with a built-in weakening rule. In\nparticular, if a term is computed to have type PURE a wp_a and it is\nannotated to have type PURE b wp_b , then F* does the following:\n\n- It computes a constraint p : a -> Type0 , which is sufficient\nto prove that a is a subtype of b , e.g., is a = int and b = nat , the constraint p is fun (x:int) -> x >= 0 .\n\n- Next, it strengthens wp_a to assert that the returned value\nvalidates the subtyping constraints p x , i.e., it builds assert_wp wp_a p , where let assert_wp (#a:Type) (w:wp a) (p: a -> Type0) \n  : wp (x:a{ p x })\n  = fun post -> w ( fun (x:a) -> p x /\\ post x)\n\nlet assert_wp (#a:Type) (w:wp a) (p: a -> Type0) \n  : wp (x:a{ p x })\n  = fun post -> w (fun (x:a) -> p x /\\ post x)\n\n\n- Finally, it produces the verification condition stronger_wp #b wp_b (assert_wp wp_a p) , where stronger_wp is defined as\nshown below: let stronger_wp (#a:Type) (wp1 wp2:wp a) : prop = forall post. wp1 post ==> wp2 post That is, for any postcondition post , the precondition wp_b post implies the original precondition wp_a post as well as\nthe subtyping constraint p x . This matches the intuition\nabout preconditions that we built earlier: it is always sound to\nrequire more in the precondition.\n\nlet stronger_wp (#a:Type) (wp1 wp2:wp a) : prop =\n   forall post. wp1 post ==> wp2 post\n\n\nThus, when we have e:PURE a wp in F*, the wp is a predicate\ntransformer for e , not necessarily the weakest one.\n\nOf course, even maybe_incr2 is not particularly idiomatic in\nF*. One would usually annotate a program with a refinement type, such\nas the one below:\n\nlet maybe_incr_tot (b:bool) (x:int)\n  : Tot (y:int { y >= x })\n  = if b\n    then let y = x + 1 in y\n    else x\n\n\nInternally to the compiler, F* treats Tot t as the following\ninstance of PURE :\n\nTot t = PURE t (fun post -> forall (x:t). post x)\n\n\nOnce Tot t is viewed as just an instance of PURE , checking if\na user annotation Tot t is stronger than the inferred\nspecification of a term PURE a wp is just as explained before.\n\nAlthough specification are easier to compute using WPs, they are\nmore natural to read and write when presented as Hoare triples, with a\nclear separation between precondition and postconditions. Further,\nwhen specifications written as Hoare triples naturally induce\nmonotonic WPs.\n\nF* provides an effect abbreviation called Pure for writing and\ntypechecking Hoare-style specifications for pure programs, and is\ndefined as shown below in prims.fst :\n\neffect Pure (a:Type) (req:Type0) (ens:a -> Type0) =\n       PURE a (fun post -> req /\\ (forall x. ens\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

Otherwise, one could write non-terminating \nfunctions like this::\n\n  let rec loop (x:unit) : False = loop x\n\nand show that ``loop () : False``, i.e., we'd have a proof term for\n``False`` and the logic would collapse.\n\nIn the previous chapter, we just saw how to define recursive functions\nto :ref:`compute the length of list <Part1_inductives_length>` and to\n:ref:`append two lists <Part1_inductives_append>`. We also said\n:ref:`earlier <Part1_ch1_arrows>` that all functions in F*'s core are\n*total*, i.e., they always return in a finite amount of time. So, you\nmay be wondering, what is it that guarantees that recursive function\nlike ``length`` and ``append`` actually terminate on all inputs?\n\nThe full details of how F* ensures termination of all functions in its\ncore involves several elements, including positivity restrictions on\ndatatype definitions and universe constraints. However, the main thing\nthat you'll need to understand at this stage is that F* includes a\ntermination check that applies to the recursive definitions of total\nfunctions. The check is a semantic check, not a syntactic criterion,\nlike in some other dependently typed languages.\n\nWe quickly sketch the basic structure of the F\\* termination check on\nrecursive functions---you'll need to understand a bit of this in order\nto write more interesting programs.\n\nA well-founded partial order on terms\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nIn order to prove a function terminating in F\\* one provides a\n*measure*: a pure expression depending on the function's\narguments. F\\* checks that this measure strictly decreases on each\nrecursive call.  The measure for the arguments of the call is compared\nto the measure for the previous call according to a well-founded\npartial order on F\\* terms. We write `v1 << v2` when `v1` precedes\n`v2` in this order.\n\n.. note::\n\n   A relation `R` is a well-founded partial order on a set `S` if, and\n   only if, `R` is a partial order on `S` and there are no infinite\n   descending chains in `S` related by `R`. For example, taking `S` to\n   be `nat`, the set of natural numbers, the integer ordering `<` is a\n   well-founded partial order (in fact, it is a total order).\n\nSince the measure strictly decreases on each recursive call, and there\nare no infinite descending chains, this guarantees that the function\neventually stops making recursive calls, i.e., it terminates.\n\n.. _Part1_precedes_relation:\n\nThe precedes relation\n.....................\n\nGiven two terms ``v1:t1`` and ``v2:t2``, we can prove ``v1 << v2``\nif any of the following are true:\n\n1. **The ordering on integers**:\n\n   ``t1 = nat`` and ``t2 = nat`` and ``v1 < v2``\n\n   Negative integers are not related by the `<<` relation, which is\n   only a _partial_ order.\n\n2. **The sub-term ordering on inductive types**\n\n    If ``v2 = D u1 ... un``, where ``D`` is a constructor of an\n    inductive type fully applied to arguments ``u1`` to ``un``, then\n    ``v1 << v2`` if either\n\n    * ``v1 = ui`` for some ``i``, i.e., ``v1`` is a sub-term of ``v2``\n\n    * ``v1 = ui x`` for some ``i`` and ``x``, i.e., ``v1`` is the\n      result of applying a sub-term of ``v2`` to some argument ``x``.\n\n\n.. _Part1_why_length_terminates:\n\n\nWhy ``length`` terminates\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nLet's look again at the definition of ``length`` and see how F* checks\nthat it terminates, i.e.,\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Part1.Inductives.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: length\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: length\n\nFirst off, the definition of ``length`` above makes use of various\nsyntactic shorthands to hide some details. If we were to write it out\nfully, it would be as shown below:\n\n.. code-block:: fstar\n\n   let rec length #a (l:list a)\n     : Tot nat (decreases l)\n     = match l with\n       | [] -> 0\n       | _ :: tl -> 1 + length tl\n\nThe main difference is on the second line. As opposed to just writing\nthe result type of ``length``, in full detail, we write\n``Tot nat (decreases l)``. This states two things\n\n* The ``Tot nat`` part states that ``length`` is a total function\n  returning a ``nat``, just as the ``nat`` did before.\n\n* The additional ``(decreases l)`` specifying a *measure*, i.e., the\n  quantity that decreases at each recursive call according the\n  well-founded relation ``<<``.\n\nTo check the definition, F* gives the recursively bound name\n(``length`` in this case) a type that's guarded by the measure. I.e.,\nfor the body of the function, ``length``\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_2d363750644c860dc3ba27c1cc49ab566de286718d48b468cbd4d93bb5891ac9_v2"}

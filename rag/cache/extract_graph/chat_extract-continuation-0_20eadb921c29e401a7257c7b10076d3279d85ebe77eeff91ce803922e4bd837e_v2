However, the term\n``bound`` is an overloaded (nullary) operator and there are two ways\nto resolve it: ``s.base.bound`` or ``c.base.bound`` and these two\nchoices are not equivalent. In particular, from ``s :\nsubtractable_bounded_unsigned_int a``, we only know that\n``s.base.bound `sub` acc`` is safe, not that ``c.base.bound `sub`\nacc`` is safe.\n\nSlicing type typeclass hierarchy too finely can lead to such coherence\nproblems that can be hard to diagnose. It's better to avoid them by\nconstruction, if at all possible. Alternatively, if such problems do\narise, one can sometimes add additional preconditions to ensure that\nthe multiple choices are actually equivalent. There are many ways to\ndo this, ranging from indexing typeclasses by their base classes, to\nadding equality hypotheses---the equality hypothesis below is\nsufficient.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/TypeclassesAlt2.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: try_sub$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: try_sub$\n\nOverloading Monadic Syntax\n--------------------------\n\nWe now look at some examples of typeclasses for *type functions*, in\nparticular, typeclasses for functors and monads.\n\n.. note ::\n\n   If you're not familiar with monads, referring back to :ref:`A First\n   Model of Computational Effects <Part2_par>` may help.\n\nIn :ref:`a previous chapter <Part2_par>`, we introduced syntactic\nsugar for monadic computations. In particular, F*'s syntax supports\nthe following:\n\n* Instead of writing ``bind f (fun x -> e)`` you can define a custom\n  ``let!``-operator and write ``let! x = f in e``.\n\n* And, instead of writing ``bind f (fun _ -> e)`` you can write\n  ``f ;! e``.\n\nNow, if we can overload the symbol ``bind`` to work with any monad,\nthen the syntactic sugar described above would work for all of\nthem. This is accomplished as follows.\n\nWe define a typeclass ``monad``, with two methods ``return`` and ``(\nlet! )``.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/MonadFunctorInference.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: monad$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: monad$\n\nDoing so introduces ``return`` and ``( let! )`` into scope at the\nfollowing types:\n\n.. code-block:: fstar\n\n   let return #m {| d : monad m |} #a (x:a) : m a = d.return x\n   let ( let! ) #m {| d : monad m |} #a #b (f:m a) (g: a -> m b) : m b = d.bind f g\n\nThat is, we now have ``( let! )`` in scope at a type general enough to\nuse with any monad instance.\n\n.. note::\n\n   There is nothing specific about ``let!``; F* allows you to add a\n   suffix of operator characters to the ``let``-token. See this file\n   for more examples of `monadic let operators\n   <https://github.com/FStarLang/FStar/blob/master/examples/misc/MonadicLetBindings.fst>`_\n\nThe type ``st s`` is a state monad parameterized by the state ``s``,\nand ``st s`` is an instance of a ``monad``.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/MonadFunctorInference.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: st$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: st$\n\nWith some basic actions ``get`` and ``put`` to read and write the\nstate, we can implement ``st`` computations with a syntax similar to\nnormal, direct-style code.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/MonadFunctorInference.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: get_inc$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: get_inc$\n\nOf course, we can also do proofs about our ``st`` computations: here's\na simple proof that ``get_put`` is ``noop``.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/MonadFunctorInference.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: get_put$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: get_put$\n\nNow, the nice thing is that since ``( let! )`` is monad polymorphic,\nwe can define other monad instances and still use the syntactic sugar\nto build computations in those monads. Here's an example with the\n``option`` monad, for computations that may fail.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/MonadFunctorInference.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: opt_monad$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: opt_monad$\n\nExercise\n........\n\nDefine a typeclass for functors, type functions ``m: Type -> Type``\nwhich support\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

Finally, it produces the verification condition ``stronger_wp #b\n     wp_b (assert_wp wp_a p)``, where ``stronger_wp`` is defined as\n     shown below:\n\n     .. literalinclude:: ../code/Pure.fst\n        :language: fstar\n        :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: stronger_wp$\n        :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: stronger_wp$\n     \n     That is, for any postcondition ``post``, the precondition ``wp_b\n     post`` implies the original precondition ``wp_a post`` as well as\n     the subtyping constraint ``p x``. This matches the intuition\n     about preconditions that we built earlier: it is always sound to\n     require more in the precondition.\n\nThus, when we have ``e:PURE a wp`` in F*, the ``wp`` is *a* predicate\ntransformer for ``e``, not necessarily the weakest one.\n\nOf course, even ``maybe_incr2`` is not particularly idiomatic in\nF*. One would usually annotate a program with a refinement type, such\nas the one below:\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Pure.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: maybe_incr_tot$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: maybe_incr_tot$\n\nInternally to the compiler, F* treats ``Tot t`` as the following\ninstance of ``PURE``:\n\n.. code-block:: fstar\n\n   Tot t = PURE t (fun post -> forall (x:t). post x)                 \n\nOnce ``Tot t`` is viewed as just an instance of ``PURE``, checking if\na user annotation ``Tot t`` is stronger than the inferred\nspecification of a term ``PURE a wp`` is just as explained before.\n\n``Pure``: Hoare Triples for ``PURE``\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nAlthough specification are easier to *compute* using WPs, they are\nmore natural to read and write when presented as Hoare triples, with a\nclear separation between precondition and postconditions. Further,\nwhen specifications written as Hoare triples naturally induce\nmonotonic WPs.\n\nF* provides an effect abbreviation called ``Pure`` for writing and\ntypechecking Hoare-style specifications for pure programs, and is\ndefined as shown below in ``prims.fst``:\n\n.. code-block:: fstar\n\n   effect Pure (a:Type) (req:Type0) (ens:a -> Type0) =\n          PURE a (fun post -> req /\\ (forall x. ens x ==> post x))\n\nThe signature of ``Pure`` is ``Pure a req ens``, where ``req`` is the\nprecondition and ``ens:a -> Type0`` is the postcondition. Using\n``Pure``, we can write the ``factorial`` function we saw at the top of\nthis chapter---F* infers a ``PURE a wp`` type for it, and relates it\nto the annotated ``Pure int req ens`` type, proving that the latter\nhas a stronger precondition and weaker postcondition.\n\nOne may wonder when one should write specifications using the notation\n``x:a -> Pure b req ens`` versus ``x:a{req} -> Tot (y:b { ens y\n})``. The two styles are closely related and choosing between them is\nmostly a matter of taste. As you have seen, until this point in the\nbook, we have not used ``Pure a req ens`` at all. However, when a\nfunction has many pre and postconditions, it is sometimes more\nconvenient to use the ``Pure a req ens`` notation, rather than\nstuffing all the constraints in refinement types.\n\n\n``GHOST`` and ``DIV``\n---------------------\n\nJust as ``PURE`` is an wp-indexed refinement of ``Tot``, F* provides\ntwo more primitive wp-indexed effects:\n\n  * ``GHOST (a:Type) (w:wp a)`` is a refinement of ``GTot a``\n\n  * ``DIV (a:Type) (w:wp a)`` is a refinement of ``Dv a``    \n\nThat is, F* uses the ``GHOST`` effect to infer total correctness WPs\nfor ghost computations, where, internally, ``GTot a`` is equivalent to\n``GHOST a (fun post -> forall x. post x)``\n\nLikewise, F* uses the ``DIV`` effect to infer *partial correctness*\nWPs for potentially non-terminating computations, where, internally,\n``Dv a`` is equivalent to ``DIV a (fun post -> forall x. post x)``.\n\nAs with ``Tot`` and ``PURE``, F* automatically relates ``GTot`` and\n``GHOST`` computations, and ``Dv`` and ``DIV`` computations. Further,\nthe effect ordering ``Tot < Dv`` and ``Tot < GTot`` extends to ``PURE\n< DIV`` and ``PURE < GHOST`` as well.\n\nThe ``prims.fst`` library also provides Hoare-triple style\nabbreviations for ``GHOST`` and ``DIV``, i.e.,\n\n.. code-block:: fstar\n\n   effect Ghost a req ens = GHOST a (fun post -> req /\\ (forall x. ens x /\\ post x))\n   effect Div a req ens = DIV a (fun post -> req /\\ (forall x. ens x /\\ post x))   \n\nThese Hoare-style abbreviations are more\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

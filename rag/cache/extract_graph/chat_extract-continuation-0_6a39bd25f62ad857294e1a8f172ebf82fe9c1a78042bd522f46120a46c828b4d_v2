Given the constraints and the focus on the types [organization, person, geo, event], and considering the text provided does not explicitly mention entities that fit these categories beyond the mathematical principles and lemmas (which were interpreted as events due to their nature of being significant mathematical findings or rules), it appears there was a misunderstanding in identifying additional entities within the given context. The text primarily discusses mathematical lemmas and principles without reference to organizations, persons, or geographical locations in a conventional sense.\n\nThe entities extracted were based on the interpretation of mathematical principles and lemmas as \"events\" due to their significance in the field of mathematics. Without explicit mentions of organizations, persons, or geographical locations related to these mathematical concepts in the provided text, it's challenging to identify additional entities fitting the requested types beyond what was previously extracted.\n\nIf the intention was to identify more entities within the mathematical or theoretical context provided, it's important to note that the text does not contain explicit references to organizations, persons, or geographical locations that could be directly extracted as entities under the given categories. The text focuses on mathematical operations and principles, which do not directly correlate with the specified entity types beyond the interpretation of these principles as \"events.\"\n\nFor completeness and accuracy based on the provided instructions and the content of the text, the initial extraction attempted to align with the requested format by interpreting mathematical principles as events.

Here's a proof—it requires three auxiliary lemmas and we'll\ndiscuss it in detail.\n\nOur first lemma relates ``partition`` to ``mem``: it proves what we\nleft out in the intrinsic specification of ``partition``, i.e., that\nall the elements in ``l₁`` satisfy ``f``, the elements in ``l₂`` do\nnot, and every element in ``l`` appears in either ``l₁`` or ``l₂``.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Part1.Quicksort.fst\n       :language: fstar\n       :start-after: SNIPPET_START: partition_mem\n       :end-before: SNIPPET_END: partition_mem\n\nOur next lemma is very specific to Quicksort. If ``l₁`` and ``l₂`` are\nalready sorted, and partitioned by ``pivot``, then slotting ``pivot``\nin the middle of ``l₁`` and ``l₂`` produces a sorted list. The\nspecification of ``sorted_concat`` uses a mixture of refinement types\n(e.g., ``l1:list int{sorted l1}``) and ``requires`` / ``ensures``\nspecifications–this is just a matter of taste.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Part1.Quicksort.fst\n       :language: fstar\n       :start-after: SNIPPET_START: sorted_concat\n       :end-before: SNIPPET_END: sorted_concat\n\nOur third lemma is a simple property about ``append`` and ``mem``.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Part1.Quicksort.fst\n       :language: fstar\n       :start-after: SNIPPET_START: append_mem\n       :end-before: SNIPPET_END: append_mem\n\nFinally, we can put the pieces together for our top-level statement\nabout the correctness of ``sort``.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Part1.Quicksort.fst\n       :language: fstar\n       :start-after: SNIPPET_START: sort_correct\n       :end-before: SNIPPET_END: sort_correct\n\nThe structure of the lemma is mirrors the structure of ``sort``\nitself.\n\n* In the base case, the proof is automatic.\n\n* In the inductive case, we partition the tail of the list and\n  recursively call the lemma on the the ``hi`` and ``lo`` components,\n  just like ``sort`` itself. The intrinsic type of ``partition`` is\n  also helpful here, using the ``length`` measure on the list to prove\n  that the induction here is well-founded.\n\n  - To prove the ``ensures`` postcondition, we apply our three\n    auxiliary lemmas.\n\n    + ``partition_mem ((<=) pivot) tl`` gives us the precondition of\n      needed to satisfy the ``requires`` clause of\n      ``sorted_concat``.\n\n    + We also need to prove the ``sorted`` refinements on ``sort lo``\n      and ``sort hi`` in order to call ``sorted_concat``, but the\n      recursive calls of the lemma give us those properties.\n\n    + After calling ``sorted_concat``, we have proven that the\n      resulting list is sorted. What's left is to prove that all the\n      elements of the input list are in the result, and ``append_mem``\n      does that, using the postcondition of ``partition_mem`` and the\n      induction hypothesis to relate the elements of ``append (sort\n      lo) (pivot :: sort hi)`` to the input list ``l``.\n\nHere's another version of the ``sort_correct`` lemma, this time\nannotated with lots of intermediate assertions.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Part1.Quicksort.fst\n       :language: fstar\n       :start-after: SNIPPET_START: sort_correct_annotated\n       :end-before: SNIPPET_END: sort_correct_annotated\n\nThis is an extreme example, annotating with assertions at almost every\nstep of the proof. However, it is indicative of a style that one often\nuses to interact with F* when doing SMT-assisted proofs. At each point\nin your program or proof, you can use ``assert`` to check what the\nprover \"knows\" at that point. See what happens if you move the\nassertions around, e.g., if you move ``assert (sort_ok lo)`` before\ncalling ``sort_correct_annotated lo``, F* will complain that it is not\nprovable.\n\nLimitations of SMT-based proofs at higher order\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nYou may be wondering why we used ``(<=) pivot`` instead of ``fun x ->\npivot <= x`` in our code. Arguably, the latter is more readable,\nparticularly to those not already familiar with functional programming\nlanguages. Well, the answer is quite technical.\n\nWe could indeed have written ``sort`` like this,\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Part1.Quicksort.fst\n       :language: fstar\n       :start-after: SNIPPET_START: sort_alt\n       :end-before: SNIPPET_END: sort_alt\n\nAnd we could have tried to write our main lemma this way:\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Part1.Quicksort.fst\n       :language: fstar\n       :start-after: SNIPPET_START: sort_alt_correct\n       :end-before: SNIPPET_END: sort_alt_correct\n\nHowever, without further assistance, F*+SMT is unable to prove the\nline at which the ``assume`` appears.

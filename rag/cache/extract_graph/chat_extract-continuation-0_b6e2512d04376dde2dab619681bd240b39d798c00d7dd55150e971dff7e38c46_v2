The context contains all known\nfacts about the current state of the program.\n\nPulse provides a command called show_proof_state that allows the\nuser to inspect the proof state at a particular program point,\naborting the Pulse checker at that point. It’s quite common when\ndeveloping a Pulse program to repeatedly inspect the proof state and\nto advance it by a single or just a few steps at a time. This makes\nthe experience of developing a Pulse program quite interactive,\nsimilar perhaps to writing tactics in F* or other languages. Except,\nin Pulse, one incrementally writes an imperative program together with\nits proof of correctness.\n\nHere below is the quadruple program again, with the proof states\nannotated at each point, and a show_proof_state command in the\nmiddle.\n\nfn quadruple (r:ref int)\nrequires pts_to r 'v\nensures pts_to r (4 * 'v)\n{\n    let v1 = !r; // Env=v1:int; _:squash (v1 == 'v)       Ctxt= pts_to r v1\n    add r v1;    // ...                                   Ctxt= pts_to r (v1 + v1)\n    show_proof_state;\n    let v2 = !r; // Env=...; v2:int; _:squash(v2==v1+v1)  Ctxt= pts_to r v2 \n    add r v2;    // Env=...                               Ctxt= pts_to r (v2 + v2)\n                 // ..                                    Ctxt= pts_to r (4 * 'v)\n}\n\n\nThe output from show_proof_state is shown below:\n\n- Current context:\n    pts_to r (reveal (hide v1) + v1) **\n    emp\n- In typing environment:\n    [_#5 : unit,\n    _#4 : squash (reveal 'v == v1),\n    v1#3 : int,\n    'v#2 : erased int,\n    r#1 : ref int]\n\n\nThe comments show how the proof state evolves after each command.\n\n- Pulse typechecks each step of a program by checking the current\nassumptions in the proof state are sufficient to prove the\nprecondition of that step, ensuring that all unused permissions\nare retained in the context—using the frame rule, discussed in\nthe previous section. Given a context that is equivalent to p ** q , if p is sufficient to prove goal , then p is\ncalled the support for goal , while q is the frame .\n\n- Like F*, Pulse tries to instantiate implicit arguments\nautomatically, e.g., at the second call to add , Pulse\nautomatically instantiates 'v to v2 .\n\n- Pulse automatically moves any pure p property in the vprop context to a squash p hypothesis in the typing\nenvironment. Pulse also proves pure properties automatically,\nby sending queries to the SMT solver, which can make use of the\nhypothesis in the typing environment only.\n\n- Pulse also uses the SMT solver to convert pts_to r (v2 + v2) to pts_to r (4 * 'v) .\n\nPulse expects the results of all stateful operations to be explicitly let -bound. For example, the following code fails to type check:\n\nfn quad_fail (r:ref int)\nrequires pts_to r 'v\nensures pts_to r (4 * 'v)\n{\n    add r (!r);\n    add r (!r);\n}\n\n\n- Expected type \"int\"; but \"!r\" has type\n  \"stt int\n       (pts_to r (reveal (*?u93*) _))\n       (fun x -> pts_to r x ** pure (reveal (*?u93*) _ == x))\"\n\n\nThe error points to the first occurrence of (!r) . The message is\nadmittedly cryptic and should be improved. As we’ll see in a later\nchapter, the type stt _ _ _ is the type of an unevaluated Pulse\ncomputation—this error complains that add expected an argument\nof type int but instead got an unevaluated computation.\n\nPulse distinguishes read-only references from read/write\nreferences. As in languages like Rust, Pulse ensures that there can be\nat most one thread that holds read/write permission to a reference,\nalthough many threads can share read-only references. This ensures\nthat Pulse programs are free of data races. At a more abstract level,\nPulse’s permission system ensures that one can reason locally about\nthe contents of memory, since if one holds read/write permission to a\nreference, one can be sure that its contents cannot be changed by some\npart of the program.\n\nTo implement this permission discipline, Pulse uses a system of\nfractional permissions, an idea due to John Boyland .  In\nparticular, the pts_to predicate that we have been using actually\nhas an additional implicit arguments that describes how much\npermission one holds on a reference.\n\nThe full type of the pts_to predicate is shown below:\n\nval pts_to (#a:Type u#0) (r:ref a) (#p:perm) (v:a) : vprop\n\n\nWe have so far been writing pts_to r v instead of pts_to #a r #p v . Usually, one does not need to write the first argument #a since it is computed by type inference; the #p:perm argument is\nmore interesting—when omitted, it defaults to the value 1.0R .

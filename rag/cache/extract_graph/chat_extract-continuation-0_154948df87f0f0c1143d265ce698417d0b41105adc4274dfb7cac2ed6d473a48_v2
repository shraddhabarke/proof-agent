If you're\nviewing this in the interactive online tutorial, you can use the\n`Ace-based <https://ace.c9.io/>`_ text editor alongside, which\nprovides some basic conveniences like syntax highlighting. However,\nbeyond casual use, most users of F* rely on one of the follwing IDE\nplugins.\n\n  * `fstar-mode.el <https://github.com/FStarLang/fstar-mode.el>`_,\n    which provides several utilities for interactively editing and\n    checking F* files in emacs.\n\n  * `fstar-vscode-assistant\n    <https://github.com/FStarLang/fstar-vscode-assistant>`_, which\n    also provides interactive editing and checking support in VS Code.\n\nThe main benefit to using these IDE plugins is that they allow you to\nincrementally check just the changing suffix of an F* file, rather\nthan rechecking the entire file in batch mode. They also provide\nstandard things like jumping to definitions, type of a symbol etc.\n\nBoth these plugins rely on a generic but custom interaction protocol\nimplemented by the F* compiler. It should be possible to implement IDE\nsupport similar to fstar-mode.el or fstar-vscode-assistant in your\nfavorite plugin-capable editor.\n\n\nBasic syntactic structure\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nAn F* program is a collection of modules, with each\nmodule represented by a single file with the filename extension\n``.fst``. Later, we'll see that a module's interface is in a separate\n``.fsti`` file and allows hiding details of a module's implementation\nfrom a client module.\n\nA module begins with the module's name (which must match the name of\nits file, i.e., ``module A`` is in ``A.fst``) and contains a sequence\nof top-level signatures and definitions. Module names always begin\nwith a capital letter.\n\n* Signatures ascribe a type to a definition, e.g., ``val f : t``.\n\nDefinitions come in several flavors: the two main forms we'll focus on\nwhen programming with total functions are\n\n* possibly recursive definitions (let bindings, ``let [rec] f = e``)\n* and, inductive type definitions (datatypes, ``type t = | D1 : t1 | ... | Dn : tn``)\n\nIn later sections, we'll see two other kinds of definition:\nuser-defined indexed effects and sub-effects.\n\nComments\n^^^^^^^^\n\nBlock comments are delimited by ``(*`` and ``*)``. Line comments begin\nwith ``//``.\n\n.. code-block:: fstar\n\n  (* this is a\n     block comment *)\n\n\n  //This is a line comment\n\n\nPrimitives\n^^^^^^^^^^\n\nEvery F* program is checked in the context of some ambient primitive\ndefinitions taken from the core F* module ``Prims``.\n\nFalse\n.....\n\nThe type ``False`` has no elements. Since there are no terms that\nsatisfy ``e : False``, the type ``False`` is the type of unprovable\npropositions.\n\nUnit\n....\n\nThe type ``unit`` has a single element denoted ``()``, i.e., ``() :\nunit``.\n\nBooleans\n........\n\nThe type ``bool`` has two elements, ``true`` and ``false``. Note, the\nlowercase ``false`` is a boolean constant, distinct from the uppercase\n``False`` type.\n\nThe following primitive boolean operators are available, in decreasing\norder of precedence.\n\n* ``not``: Boolean negation (unary, prefix)\n* ``&&``: Boolean conjunction (binary, infix)\n* ``||``: Boolean disjunction (binary, infix)\n\nConditionals\n############\n\nYou can, of course, branch on a boolean with ``if/then/else``\n\n.. code-block:: fstar\n\n  if b then 1 else 0\n\n  if b1 && b2 || b3\n  then 17\n  else 42\n\n\nIntegers\n........\n\nThe type ``int`` represents unbounded, primitive mathematical\nintegers. Its elements are formed from the literals ``0, 1, 2, ...``,\nand the following primitive operators, in decreasing order of\nprecedence.\n\n* ``-``: Unary negation (prefix)\n* ``-``: Subtraction (infix)\n* ``+``: Addition (infix)\n* ``/``: Euclidean division (infix)\n* ``%``: Euclidean modulus (infix)\n* ``op_Multiply``: Unfortunately, the traditional multiplication\n  symbol ``*`` is reserved by default for the tuple type\n  constructor. Use the module ``FStar.Mul`` to treat ``*`` as integer\n  multiplication.\n* ``<`` : Less than (infix)\n* ``<=``: Less than or equal (infix)\n* ``>`` : Greater than (infix)\n* ``>=``: Greater than or equal (infix)\n\n.. note::\n   \n    F* follows the OCaml style of no negative integer literals,\n    instead negate a positive integer like ``(- 1)``.\n    \n.. _Part1_ch1_boolean_refinements:\n\nBoolean refinement types\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nThe F* core library, ``Prims``, defines the type of\nnatural numbers as follows\n\n.. code-block:: fstar\n\n       let nat = x:int{x >= 0}\n\nThis is\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>F*<|>ORGANIZATION<|>F* is a programming language with a focus on the syntax of the language and core concepts of types and functions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ACE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Ace is an online text editor that provides basic conveniences like syntax highlighting for F* programming)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EMACS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Emacs is a text editor which supports F* programming through the fstar-mode.el plugin)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VS CODE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>VS Code is a text editor which supports F* programming through the fstar-vscode-assistant plugin)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>F* COMPILER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The F* Compiler implements a custom interaction protocol to support IDE plugins for F* programming)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PRIMS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Prims is the core F* module that includes ambient primitive definitions for F* programming)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>F*<|>ACE<|>F* can be used with the Ace text editor for programming<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>F*<|>EMACS<|>F* supports programming in Emacs through a specific plugin<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>F*<|>VS CODE<|>F* supports programming in VS Code through a specific plugin<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>F*<|>F* COMPILER<|>The F* Compiler provides the necessary backend for F* programming in various IDEs<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>F*<|>PRIMS<|>F* programs are checked in the context of Prims, the core F* module<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

However, as your development starts to depend\non an ever larger stack of modules, there’s the danger that at some\npoint, your proofs are impacted by some bad choice of quantifiers in\nsome module that you have forgotten about. In that case, you may find\nthat seemingly simple proofs take many seconds to go through. In this\nsection, we’ll look at a few things you can do to diagnose such\nproblems.\n\nThe first thing we’ll look at is an F* option to remove facts from the\ncontext.\n\n#push-options \"--using_facts_from 'Prims FStar.Seq'\"\nlet warmup2 (x:bool { x == true }) = assert x\n\nlet test2 (a:Type) (s0 s1 s2: seq a)\n  : Lemma (Seq.append (Seq.append s0 s1) s2 `Seq.equal`\n           Seq.append s0 (Seq.append s1 s2))\n  = ()\n\n\nThe --using_facts_from option retains only facts from modules that\nmatch the namespace-selector string provided. In this case, the\nselector shrinks the context from 11MB and 20,000 assertions to around\n1MB and 2,000 assertions and the query stats reports that the proof\nnow goes through in just 15 milliseconds—a sizeable speedup even\nthough the absolute numbers are still small.\n\nOf course, deciding which facts to filter from your context is not\neasy. For example, if you had only retained FStar.Seq and forgot\nto include Prims , the proof would have failed. So, the --using_facts_from option isn’t often very useful.\n\nWhen Z3 finds a proof, it can report which facts from the context were\nrelevant to the proof. This collection of facts is called the unsat\ncore, because Z3 has proven that the facts from the context and the\nnegated goal are unsatisfiable. F* has an option to record and replay\nthe unsat core for each query and F* refers to the recorded unsat cores\nas “hints”.\n\nHere’s how to use hints:\n\n- Record hints fstar.exe --record_hints ContextPollution.fst This produces a file called ContextPollution.fst.hints The format of a hints file is internal and subject to change,\nbut it is a textual format and you can roughly see what it\ncontains. Here’s a fragment from it: [\n   \"ContextPollution.test1\",\n   1,\n   2,\n   1,\n   [\n     \"@MaxIFuel_assumption\", \"@query\", \"equation_Prims.nat\",\n     \"int_inversion\", \"int_typing\", \"lemma_FStar.Seq.Base.lemma_eq_intro\",\n     \"lemma_FStar.Seq.Base.lemma_index_app1\",\n     \"lemma_FStar.Seq.Base.lemma_index_app2\",\n     \"lemma_FStar.Seq.Base.lemma_len_append\",\n     \"primitive_Prims.op_Addition\", \"primitive_Prims.op_Subtraction\",\n     \"projection_inverse_BoxInt_proj_0\",\n     \"refinement_interpretation_Tm_refine_542f9d4f129664613f2483a6c88bc7c2\",\n     \"refinement_interpretation_Tm_refine_ac201cf927190d39c033967b63cb957b\",\n     \"refinement_interpretation_Tm_refine_d83f8da8ef6c1cb9f71d1465c1bb1c55\",\n     \"typing_FStar.Seq.Base.append\", \"typing_FStar.Seq.Base.length\"\n   ],\n   0,\n   \"3f144f59e410fbaa970cffb0e20df75d\"\n ] This is the hint entry for the query with whose id is (ContextPollution.test1, 1) The next two fields are the fuel and ifuel used for the query, 2 and 1 in this case. Then, we have the names of all the facts in the unsat core for this\nquery: you can see that it was only about 20 facts that were\nneeded, out of the 20,000 that were originally present. The second to last field is not used—it is always 0. And the last field is a hash of the query that was issued.\n\nfstar.exe --record_hints ContextPollution.fst\n\n\n[\n   \"ContextPollution.test1\",\n   1,\n   2,\n   1,\n   [\n     \"@MaxIFuel_assumption\", \"@query\", \"equation_Prims.nat\",\n     \"int_inversion\", \"int_typing\", \"lemma_FStar.Seq.Base.lemma_eq_intro\",\n     \"lemma_FStar.Seq.Base.lemma_index_app1\",\n     \"lemma_FStar.Seq.Base.lemma_index_app2\",\n     \"lemma_FStar.Seq.Base.lemma_len_append\",\n     \"primitive_Prims.op_Addition\", \"primitive_Prims.op_Subtraction\",\n     \"projection_inverse_BoxInt_proj_0\",\n     \"refinement_interpretation_Tm_refine_542f9d4f129664613f2483a6c88bc7c2\",\n     \"refinement_interpretation_Tm_refine_ac201cf927190d39c033967b63cb957b\",\n     \"refinement_interpretation_Tm_refine_d83f8da8ef6c1cb9f71d1465c1bb1c55\",\n     \"typing_FStar.Seq.Base.append\", \"typing_FStar.Seq.Base.length\"\n   ],\n   0,\n   \"3f144f59e410f\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>F*<|>ORGANIZATION<|>F* is a programming language designed for formal verification, allowing developers to write programs that are provably correct)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PRIMS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Prims is a module in F* that includes primitive types and functions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FSTAR.SEQ<|>ORGANIZATION<|>FStar.Seq is a module in F* that deals with sequences, providing functions and lemmas for sequence manipulation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Z3<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Z3 is a theorem prover from Microsoft Research used by F* for solving logical constraints and verifying proofs)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FSTAR.SEQ<|>F*<|>FStar.Seq is a module within the F* programming language ecosystem, providing sequence manipulation capabilities<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PRIMS<|>F*<|>Prims is a foundational module in F*, offering primitive types and functions essential for the language's operation<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Z3<|>F*<|>Z3 is utilized by F* as the underlying solver for verifying the correctness of programs written in F*<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

This is accomplished as follows.\n\nWe define a typeclass monad , with two methods return and ( let! ) .\n\nclass monad (m:Type -> Type) =\n{\n   return : (#a:Type -> a -> m a);\n   ( let! )  : (#a:Type -> #b:Type -> (f:m a) -> (g:(a -> m b)) -> m b);\n}\n\n\nDoing so introduces return and ( let! ) into scope at the\nfollowing types:\n\nlet return #m {| d : monad m |} #a (x:a) : m a = d.return x\nlet ( let! ) #m {| d : monad m |} #a #b (f:m a) (g: a -> m b) : m b = d.bind f g\n\n\nThat is, we now have ( let! ) in scope at a type general enough to\nuse with any monad instance.\n\nNote\n\nThere is nothing specific about let! ; F* allows you to add a\nsuffix of operator characters to the let -token. See this file\nfor more examples of monadic let operators\n\nThe type st s is a state monad parameterized by the state s ,\nand st s is an instance of a monad .\n\nlet st (s:Type) (a:Type) = s -> a & s\n\ninstance st_monad s : monad (st s) =\n{\n   return = (fun #a (x:a) -> (fun s -> x, s));\n   ( let! ) = (fun #a #b (f: st s a) (g: a -> st s b) (s0:s) ->\n               let x, s1 = f s0 in\n               g x s1);\n}\n\n\nWith some basic actions get and put to read and write the\nstate, we can implement st computations with a syntax similar to\nnormal, direct-style code.\n\nlet get #s\n  : st s s\n  = fun s -> s, s\n\nlet put #s (x:s)\n  : st s unit\n  = fun _ -> (), x\n\nlet get_inc =\n  let! x = get in\n  return (x + 1)\n\n\nOf course, we can also do proofs about our st computations: here’s\na simple proof that get_put is noop .\n\nlet get_put #s =\n  let! x = get #s in\n  put x\n\nlet noop #s : st s unit = return ()\n\nlet get_put_identity (s:Type)\n  : Lemma (get_put #s `FStar.FunctionalExtensionality.feq` noop #s)\n  = ()\n\n\nNow, the nice thing is that since ( let! ) is monad polymorphic,\nwe can define other monad instances and still use the syntactic sugar\nto build computations in those monads. Here’s an example with the option monad, for computations that may fail.\n\ninstance opt_monad : monad option =\n{\n   return = (fun #a (x:a) -> Some x);\n   ( let! ) = (fun #a #b (x:option a) (y: a -> option b) ->\n             match x with\n             | None -> None\n             | Some a -> y a)\n}\n\nlet raise #a : option a = None\n\nlet div (n m:int) =\n  if m = 0 then raise\n  else return (n / m)\n\nlet test_opt_monad (i j k:nat) =\n  let! x = div i j in\n  let! y = div i k in\n  return (x + y)\n\n\nDefine a typeclass for functors, type functions m: Type -> Type which support the operations fmap : (a -> b) -> m a -> m b .\n\nBuild instances of functor for a few basic types, e.g., list .\n\nDerive an instance for functors from a monad, i.e., prove\n\ninstance monad_functor #m {| monad m |} : functor m = admit()\n\nThis file provides\nthe definitions you need.\n\nAnswer\n\nclass functor (m:Type -> Type) =\n{\n  fmap: (#a:Type -> #b:Type -> (a -> b) -> m a -> m b);\n}\n\nlet id (a:Type) = a\n\ninstance id_functor : functor id =\n{\n  fmap = (fun #a #b f -> f);\n}\n\nlet test_id (a:Type) (f:a -> a) (x:id a) = fmap f x\n\ninstance option_functor : functor option =\n{\n  fmap = (fun #a #b (f:a -> b) (x:option a) ->\n            match x with\n            | None -> None\n            | Some y -> Some (f y));\n}\n\nlet test_option (f:int -> bool) (x:option int) = fmap f x\n\ninstance monad_functor #m (d:monad m) : functor m =\n{\n  fmap = (fun #a #b (f:a -> b) (c:m a) -> let! x = c in return (f x))\n}\n\n\nMany monad-like structures have been proposed to structure effectful\ncomputations. Each of these structures can be captured as a typeclass\nand used with F*’s syntactic sugar for let operators.\n\nAs an example, we look at graded monads , a construction studied by\nShin-Ya Katsumata and others, in several papers . This\nexample illustrates the flexibility of typeclasses, including\ntypeclasses for types that themselves are indexed by other\ntypeclasses.\n\nThe main idea of a graded monad is to index a monad with a monoid,\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MONAD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A typeclass with methods return and (let!) for structuring computations)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ST S<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A state monad parameterized by the state s, an instance of a monad)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OPTION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A monad instance for computations that may fail)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FUNCTOR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A typeclass for type functions supporting operations like fmap)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ID_FUNCTOR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An instance of functor for identity functions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OPTION_FUNCTOR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An instance of functor for the option type)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MONAD_FUNCTOR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Derives an instance of functor from a monad instance)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GRADED MONAD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A monad indexed by a monoid, illustrating the flexibility of typeclasses)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ST S<|>MONAD<|>ST S is an instance of the monad typeclass<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OPTION<|>MONAD<|>Option is an instance of the monad typeclass for computations that may fail<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ID_FUNCTOR<|>FUNCTOR<|>ID Functor is an instance of the functor typeclass for identity functions<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OPTION_FUNCTOR<|>FUNCTOR<|>Option Functor is an instance of the functor typeclass for the option type<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MONAD_FUNCTOR<|>FUNCTOR<|>Monad Functor derives an instance of functor from a monad instance<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GRADED MONAD<|>MONAD<|>Graded Monad is a type of monad indexed by a monoid, showing typeclass flexibility<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

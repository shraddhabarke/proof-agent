In this section, we look in\ndetail at definitional equality, propositional equality, extensional\nequality of functions, and decidable equality. These topics are fairly\ntechnical, but are core features of the language and their treatment\nin F* makes essential use of an indexed inductive type, equals #t x y , a proposition asserting the equality of x:t and y:t .\n\nDepending on your level of comfort with functional programming and\ndependent types, you may want to skip or just skim this chapter on a\nfirst reading, returning to it for reference if something is unclear.\n\nOne of the main distinctive feature of a type theory like F* (or Coq,\nLean, Agda etc., and in contrast with foundations like set theory) is\nthat computation is a primitive notion within the theory, such that\nlambda terms that are related by reduction are considered\nidentical. For example, there is no way to distinguish within the\ntheory between ( λ x . x ) 0 and 0 , since the former\nreduces in a single step of computation to the latter. Terms that are\nrelated by reduction are called definitionally equal , and this is\nthe most primitive notion of equality in the language. Definitional\nequality is a congruence, in the sense that within any context T [ ] , T [ n ] is definitionally equal to T [ m ] ,\nwhen n and m are definitionally equal.\n\nSince definitionally equal terms are identical, all type theories,\nincluding F*, will implicit allow treating a term v:t as if it had\ntype t' , provided t and t' are definitionally equal.\n\nLet’s look at a few examples, starting again with our type of\nlength-indexed vectors.\n\ntype vec (a:Type) : nat -> Type =\n  | Nil : vec a 0\n  | Cons : #n:nat -> hd:a -> tl:vec a n -> vec a (n + 1)\n\n\nAs the two examples below show a v:vec a n is also has type vec a m when n and m are definitionally equal.\n\nlet conv_vec_0 (#a:Type) (v:vec a ((fun x -> x) 0))\n  : vec a 0\n  = v\n\nlet conv_vec_1 (#a:Type) (v:vec a ((fun x -> x + 1) 0))\n  : vec a 1\n  = v\n\n\nIn the first case, a single step of computation (a function\napplication, or β -reduction) suffices; while the second\ncase requires a β -reduction followed by a step of integer\narithmetic. In fact, any computational step, including unfolding\ndefintions, conditionals, fixpoint reduction etc. are all allowed when\ndeciding if terms are definitionally equivalent—the code below\nillustrates how F* implicitly reduces the factorial function when\ndeciding if two terms are definitionally equal.\n\nlet rec factorial (n:nat)\n  : nat\n  = if n = 0 then 1\n    else n * factorial (n - 1)\n\nlet conv_vec_6 (#a:Type) (v:vec a (factorial 3))\n  : vec a 6\n  = v\n\n\nOf course, there is nothing particularly special about the vec type or its indices. Definitional equality applies everywhere, as\nillustrated below.\n\nlet conv_int (x : (fun b -> if b then int else bool) true)\n  : int\n  = x + 1\n\n\nHere, when adding 1 to x , F* implicitly converts the type of x to int by performing a β -reduction followed by a\ncase analysis.\n\nDefinitional equality is so primitive in the language that there is no\nway to even state within the terms that two terms are definitional\nequal, i.e., there is no way to state within the logic that two terms\nare related to each other by reduction. The closest one can get\nstating that two terms are equal is through a notion called a provable equality or propositional equality.\n\nIn thinking of propositions as types, we mentioned at the very\nstart of the book , that one can think of a type t as a\nproposition, or a statement of a theorem, and e : t as a proof of\nthe theorem t . So, one might ask, what type corresponds to the\nequality proposition and how are proofs of equality represented?\n\nThe listing below shows the definition of an inductive type equals #a x y representing the equality proposotion between x:a and y:a . Its single constructor Reflexivity is an equality proof.\n\ntype equals (#a:Type) : a -> a -> Type =\n  | Reflexivity : #x:a -> equals x x\n\n\nIts easy to construct some simple equality proofs. In the second case,\njust as with our vector examples, F* accepts Reflexivity #_ #6 as\nhaving type equals (factorial 3) 6 , since equals 6 6 is\ndefinitionally equal to equals (factorial 3) 6 .\n\nlet z_equals_z\n  : equals 0 0\n  = Reflexivity\n\nlet fact_3_eq_6\n  : equals (factorial 3) 6\n  = Reflexivity #_ #6\n\n\nAlthough the only constructor of equals is Reflexivity , as the\nthe following code shows, equals is actually an equivalence\nrelation, satisfying (in addition to reflexivity) the laws of symmetry\nand transitivity.\n\nlet reflexivity #a (x:a)\n  : equals x x\n  = Reflexivity\n\nlet symmetry #a (x y : a) (pf:equals\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_b4e4c69951c18980ad9d73f1da84f8ff13ac208318ec198a95e786205949b525_v2"}

If you want to rely on splitting\nqueries for verifying your program please use the '--split_queries\nalways' option rather than relying on it implicitly.\n\n\nBy default, F* collects all the proof obligations in a top-level F*\ndefinition and presents it to Z3 in a single query with several\nconjuncts. Usually, this allows Z3 to efficiently solve all the\nconjuncts together, e.g., the proof search for one conjunct may yield\nclauses useful to complete the search for other clauses. However,\nsometimes, the converse can be true: the proof search for separate\nconjuncts can interfere with each other negatively, leading to the\nentire proof to fail even when every conjunct may be provable if tried\nseparately. Additionally, when F* calls Z3, it applies the current\nrlimit setting for every query. If a query contains N conjuncts,\nsplitting the conjuncts into N separate conjuncts is effectively a\nrlimit multiplier, since each query can separately consume resources\nas much as the current rlimit.\n\nIf the single query with several conjunct fails without Z3 reporting\nany further information that F* can reconstruct into a localized error\nmessage, F* splits the query into its conjuncts and tries each of\nthem in isolation, so as to isolate the failing conjunct it\nany. However, sometimes, when tried in this mode, the proof of all\nconjuncts can succeed.\n\nOne way to respond to Warning 349 is to follow what it says and enable --split_queries always explicitly, at least for the program fragment in\nquestion. This can sometimes stabilize a previously unstable\nproof. However, it may also end up deferring an underlying\nproof-performance problem. Besides, even putting stability aside,\nsplitting queries into their conjuncts results in somewhat slower\nproofs.\n\nHere is a revision of Alex’s program that addresses the quantifier\ninstantiation problem. There are a few elements to the solution.\n\n[@@\"opaque_to_smt\"]\nlet unbounded (f: nat → int) = forall (m: nat). exists (n:nat). abs (f n) > m\n\nlet instantiate_unbounded (f:nat → int { unbounded f }) (m:nat)\n  : Lemma (exists (n:nat). abs (f n) > m)\n  = reveal_opaque (`%unbounded) (unbounded f)\n\nassume\nval f : (z:(nat → int){unbounded z})\n\nlet g : (nat -> int) = fun x -> f (x+1)\n\n#push-options \"--query_stats --fuel 0 --ifuel 0\"\nlet find_above_for_g (m:nat) : Lemma(exists (i:nat). abs(g i) > m) = \n  instantiate_unbounded f m;\n  eliminate exists (n:nat). abs(f n) > m\n  returns exists (i:nat). abs(g i) > m with _. begin\n    let m1 = abs(f n) in\n    if n>=1 then assert (abs(g (n-1)) > m)\n    else begin\n      instantiate_unbounded f m1;\n      eliminate exists (n1:nat). abs (f n1) > m1\n      returns exists (i:nat). abs(g i) > m with _. \n      begin\n        assert (abs (g (n1-1)) > m)\n      end \n    end \n  end \n\n\n- Marking definitions as opaque The attribute [@@\"opaque_to_smt\"] on the definition of unbounded instructs F* to not encode that definition to the SMT\nsolver. So, the problematic alternating quantifier is no longer\nin the global scope.\n\n- Selectively revealing the definition within a scope Of course, we still want to reason about the unbounded\npredicate. So, we provide a lemma, instantiate_unbounded , that\nallows the caller to explicity instantiate the assumption\nthat f is unbounded on some lower bound m . To prove the lemma, we use FStar.Pervasives.reveal_opaque :\nits first argument is the name of a symbol that should be\nrevealed; its second argument is a term in which that definition\nshould be revealed. It this case, it proves that unbounded f is equal to forall m. exists n. abs (f n) > m . With this fact available in the local scope, Z3 can prove the\nlemma. You want to use reveal_opaque carefully, since with\nhaving revealed it, Z3 has the problematic alternating quantifier\nin scope and could go into a matching loop.

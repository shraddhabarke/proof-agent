We now turn to a\ntypeclass that leverages F*'s dependent types by generalizing the\ninterface of bounded unsigned integers that we developed in a\n:ref:`previous chapter <Part3_interfaces>`.\n\nA type ``a`` is in the class ``bounded_unsigned_int``, when it\nadmits:\n\n  * An element ``bound : a``, representing the maximum value\n\n  * A pair of functions ``from_nat`` and ``to_nat`` that form a\n    bijection between ``a`` and natural numbers less than ``to_nat\n    bound``\n\nThis is captured by the ``class`` below:\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/TypeclassesAlt3.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: bounded_unsigned_int$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: bounded_unsigned_int$\n\n.. note ::\n\n   The attribute ``FStar.Tactics.Typeclasses.no_method`` on the\n   ``properties`` field instructs F* to not generate a typeclass\n   method for this field. This is useful here, since we don't really\n   want to overload the name ``properties`` as an operator over all\n   instances bound the class. It's often convenient to simply ``open\n   FStar.Tactics.Typeclasses`` when using typeclasses, or to use a\n   module abbreviation like ``module TC = FStar.Tactics.Typeclasses``\n   so that you don't have to use a fully qualified name for\n   ``no_method``.\n\nFor all ``bounded_unsigned_ints``, one can define a generic ``fits``\npredicate, corresponding to the bounds check condition that we\nintroduced in the ``UInt32`` interface.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/TypeclassesAlt3.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: fits$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: fits$\n\nLikewise, the predicate ``related_ops`` defines when an operation\n``bop`` on bounded integers is equivalent to an operation ``iop`` on\nmathematical integers.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/TypeclassesAlt3.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: related_ops$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: related_ops$\n\nTypeclass Inheritance\n.....................\n\nOur ``bounded_unsigned_int a`` class just showed that ``a`` is in a\nbijection with natural numbers below some bound. Now, we can define a\nseparate class, extending ``bounded_unsigned_int`` with the operations\nwe want, like addition, subtraction, etc.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/TypeclassesAlt3.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: bui_ops$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: bui_ops$\n\nThe class above makes use of *typeclass inheritance*. The ``base``\nfield stores an instance of the base class ``bounded_unsigned_int``,\nwhile the remaining fields extend it with:\n\n  * ``add``: a bounded addition operation\n  * ``sub``: a bounded subtraction operation\n  * ``lt`` : a comparison function\n  * ``properties``, which show that\n\n      - ``add`` is related to integer addition ``+``\n      - ``sub`` is related to integer subtraction ``-``\n      - ``lt`` is related to ``<``\n      - and that ``sub bound x`` is always safe\n\nTypeclass inheritance in the form of additional fields like ``base``\nis completely flexible, e.g., multiple inheritance is permissible\n(though, as we'll see below, should be used with care, to prevent\nsurprises).\n\nTreating an instance of a class as an instance of one its base classes\nis easily coded as instance-generating function. The code below says\nthat an instance from ``bounded_unsigned_int a`` can be derived from\nan instance of ``d : bounded_unsigned_int_ops a`` just by projecting\nits ``base`` field.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/TypeclassesAlt3.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: ops_base$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: ops_base$\n\n\nInfix Operators\n...............\n\nF* does not allows the fields of a record to be named using infix\noperator symbols. This will likely change in the future. For now,\nto use custom operations with infix notation for typeclass methods,\none has to define them by hand:\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/TypeclassesAlt3.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: ops$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: ops$\n\nDerived Instances\n.................\n\nWe've already seen how typeclass inheritance allows a class to induce\nan instance of its base class(es). However, not all derived instances\nare due to explicit inheritance---some instances can be *computed*\nfrom others.\n\nFor example, here's a class ``eq`` for types that support decidable\nequality.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/TypeclassesAlt3.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: eq$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: eq$\n\nWe'll write ``x =?= y`` for an equality comparison method from this\nclass, to not confuse it with F*'s built-in decidable equality ``(=)``\non ``eqtype``.\n\nNow, from an instance of ``bounded_unsigned_int_ops a`` we can\ncompute an instance of ``eq a``, since we have ``<^``, a strict\ncomparison operator that we know is\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BOUNDED_UNSIGNED_INT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A typeclass in F* that generalizes the interface of bounded unsigned integers, including a maximum value bound and bijection functions between the type and natural numbers less than the bound)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FITS<|>EVENT<|>A generic predicate in F* for bounded_unsigned_ints that corresponds to a bounds check condition)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RELATED_OPS<|>EVENT<|>A predicate in F* that defines when an operation on bounded integers is equivalent to an operation on mathematical integers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BOUNDED_UNSIGNED_INT_OPS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A typeclass in F* that extends bounded_unsigned_int with operations like addition, subtraction, and comparison)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EQ<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A typeclass in F* for types that support decidable equality, allowing comparison between instances of a type)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BOUNDED_UNSIGNED_INT_OPS<|>BOUNDED_UNSIGNED_INT<|>BOUNDED_UNSIGNED_INT_OPS extends BOUNDED_UNSIGNED_INT with additional operations<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EQ<|>BOUNDED_UNSIGNED_INT_OPS<|>An instance of EQ can be computed from an instance of BOUNDED_UNSIGNED_INT_OPS<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

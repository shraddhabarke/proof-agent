For example, the effect system needs to\nensures that the total part of a program that is proven to always\nterminate never calls a function in the divergent fragment (since that\nfunction call may loop forever). Or, that the runtime behavior of a\ncompiled program does not depend on ghost computations that get erased\nby the compiler.\n\nIn a paper from 1999 called A Core Calculus of Dependency , Abadi et\nal. present DCC, a language with a very generic way to track\ndependences. DCCâ€™s type system includes an indexed, monadic type T l , where the index l ranges over the elements of a\nlattice, i.e., the indexes are arranged in a partial order. DCCâ€™s type\nsystem ensures that a computation with type T l can depend on\nanother computation with type T m only if m â‰¤ l in\nthe latticeâ€™s partial order.  F*â€™s effect system is inspired by DCC,\nand builds on a 2011 paper by Swamy et al. called Lightweight Monadic\nProgramming in ML which develops a DCC-like system for an ML-like programming language.\n\nAt its core, F*â€™s effect system includes the following three elements:\n\nComputation Types : F*â€™s type system includes a notion of computation type , a type of the form M t where M is an effect label and t is the return type of the computation. A term e can be given the computation type M t when executing e exhibits at-most the effect M and (possibly) returns a value of\ntype t . We will refine this intuition as we go along. In contrast\nwith computation types, the types that we have seen so far ( unit , bool , int , list int , other inductive types, refinement\ntypes, and arrows) are called value types .\n\nPartially Ordered Effect Labels : The effect label of a computation\ntype is drawn from an open-ended, user-extensible set of labels, where\nthe labels are organized in a user-chosen partial order. For example,\nunder certain conditions, one can define the label M to be a\nsub-effect of N , i.e., M < N .  For any pair of labels M and N , a partial function lub M N (for least upper bound)\ncomputes the least label greater than both M and N , if any.\n\nTyping Rules to Track Dependences : The key part of the effect\nsystem is a rule for composing computations sequentially using let x = e1 in e2 . Suppose e1 : M t1 , and suppose e2 : N t2 assuming x:t1 , then the composition let x = e1 in e2 has type L t2 , where L = lub M N â€”if lub M N is not defined, then\nthe let -binding is rejected. Further, a computation with type M t can be implicitly given the type N t , when M < N , i.e.,\nmoving up the effect hierarchy is always permitted. The resulting\ntyping discipline enforces the same dependence-tracking property as\nDCC: a computation M t can only depend on N t when lub M N = M .\n\nIn full generality, F*â€™s computation types are more complex than just\nan effect label M and a result type (i.e., more than just M t ), and relying on F*â€™s dependent types, computation types do more\nthan just track dependences, e.g., a computation type in F* can also\nprovide full, functional correctness specifications. The papers\nreferenced below provide some context and we discuss various elements\nof these papers throughout this part of the book.\n\n- Verifying Higher-order Programs with the Dijkstra Monad , introduces the\nidea of a Dijkstra monad, a construction to structure the\ninference of weakest preconditions of effectful computations.\n\n- This 2016 paper, Dependent Types and Multi-Monadic Effects in F* ,\nhas become the canonical reference for F*. It shows how to combine\nmultiple Dijkstra monads with a DCC-like system.\n\n- Dijkstra Monads for Free presents an\nalgorithm to construct Dijkstra monads automatically for a class\nof simple monads.\n\n- Dijkstra Monads for All generalizes the\nconstruction to apply to relate any computational monad to a\nspecificational counterpart, so long as the two are related by a\nmonad morphism.\n\n- Programming and Proving with Indexed Effects describes\nF*â€™s user-defined effect system in its most general form, allowing\nit to be applied to any indexed effects, including Dijkstra\nmonads, but several other constructions as well.\n\nÂ© Copyright 2020, Microsoft Research.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>F*<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A programming language designed to track dependences among program parts with an effect system inspired by DCC and developed further for ML-like languages)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DCC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A language presented by Abadi et al. in 1999 that tracks dependences with a generic type system)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ABADI ET AL.<|>PERSON<|>Researchers who presented DCC, a core calculus of dependency, in 1999)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SWAMY ET AL.<|>PERSON<|>Researchers who developed a DCC-like system for an ML-like programming language in a 2011 paper)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MICROSOFT RESEARCH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The institution that holds the copyright for the discussed materials on F* and its computation types)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>F*<|>DCC<|>F*'s effect system is inspired by DCC, indicating a foundational relationship in its design<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>F*<|>SWAMY ET AL.<|>F*'s development was influenced by the work of Swamy et al., showing a direct intellectual contribution<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DCC<|>ABADI ET AL.<|>DCC was presented by Abadi et al., establishing them as the creators of the language<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>F*<|>MICROSOFT RESEARCH<|>Microsoft Research holds the copyright for the materials discussing F*, indicating ownership or affiliation<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

F* is able to prove\nthat these functions terminate, just by using the default measure as\nusual.\n\ntype tree =\n  | Terminal : tree\n  | Internal : node -> tree\n\nand node = {\n  left : tree;\n  data : int;\n  right : tree\n}\n\nlet rec incr_tree (x:tree)\n  : tree\n  = match x with\n    | Terminal -> Terminal\n    | Internal node -> Internal (incr_node node)\n\nand incr_node (n:node)\n  : node\n  = {\n      left = incr_tree n.left;\n      data = n.data + 1;\n      right = incr_tree n.right\n    }\n\n\nNote\n\nSometimes, a little trick with lexicographic orderings can help\nprove mutually recursive functions correct. We include it here as a\ntip, you can probably skip it on a first read.\n\nlet rec foo (l:list int)\n  : Tot int (decreases %[l;0])\n  = match l with\n    | [] -> 0\n    | x :: xs -> bar xs\nand bar (l:list int)\n  : Tot int (decreases %[l;1])\n  = foo l\n\n\nWhat’s happening here is that when foo l calls bar , the\nargument xs is legitimately a sub-term of l . However, bar l simply calls back foo l , without decreasing the\nargument. The reason this terminates, however, is that bar can\nfreely call back foo , since foo will only ever call bar again with a smaller argument. You can convince F* of this by\nwriting the decreases clauses shown, i.e., when bar calls foo , l doesn’t change, but the second component of the\nlexicographic ordering does decrease, i.e., 0 << 1 .\n\nHaving seen a few examples at work, we can now describe how the\ntermination check works in general.\n\nNote\n\nWe use a slightly more mathematical notation here, so that we can\nbe precise. If it feels unfamiliar, you needn’t understand this\ncompletely at first. Continue with the examples and refer back to\nthis section, if and when you feel like a precise description would\nbe helpful.\n\nWhen defining a recursive function\n\ni.e., f is a function with several arguments x 1 : t 1 , . . . , x n : t n , returning r with measure m , mutually\nrecursively with other functions of several arguments at type:\n\nwe check the definition of the function body of f (i.e., e ) with all the mutually recursive functions\nin scope, but at types that restrict their domain, in the following\nsense:\n\nThat is, each function in the mutually recursive group can only be\napplied to arguments that precede the current formal parameters of f according to the annotated measures of each\nfunction.\n\nClick here for the exercise file.\n\nHere’s a function to compute the n -th Fibonacci number.\n\nlet rec fibonacci (n:nat)\n  : nat\n  = if n <= 1\n    then 1\n    else fibonacci (n - 1) + fibonacci (n - 2)\n\n\nHere’s a more efficient, tail-recursive, linear-time variant.\n\nlet rec fib a b n =\n   match n with\n   | 0 -> a\n   | _ -> fib b (a+b) (n-1)\n\nlet fibonacci n = fib 1 1 n\n\n\nAdd annotations to the functions to get F* to accept them, in\nparticular, proving that fib terminates.\n\nAnswer\n\nlet rec fib (a b n:nat)\n  : Tot nat (decreases n)\n  = match n with\n    | 0 -> a\n    | _ -> fib b (a+b) (n-1)\n\nlet fibonacci (n:nat) : nat = fib 1 1 n\n\n\nClick here for the exercise file.\n\nHere is a function to reverse a list:\n\nlet rec rev #a (l:list a)\n  : list a\n  = match l with\n    | [] -> []\n    | hd::tl -> append (rev tl) hd\n\n\nBut, it is not very efficient, since it is not tail recursive and,\nworse, it is quadratic, it traverses the reversed tail of the list\neach time to add the first element to the end of it.\n\nThis version is more efficient, because it is tail recursive and\nlinear.\n\nlet rec rev_aux l1 l2 =\n  match l2 with\n  | []     -> l1\n  | hd :: tl -> rev_aux (hd :: l1) tl\n\nlet rev l = rev_aux [] l\n\n\nAdd type annotations to rev_aux and rev , proving, in\nparticular, that rev_aux terminates.\n\nAnswer\n\nlet rec rev_aux #a (l1 l2:list a)\n  : Tot (list a) (decreases l2)\n  = match l2 with\n    | []     -> l1\n    | hd :: tl -> rev_aux (hd :: l1) tl\n\nlet rev #a (l:list a) : list a = rev_aux [] l\n\n\n© Copyright 2020, Microsoft Research.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>F*<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A programming language designed to prove the correctness of programs and their termination)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INCR_TREE<|>EVENT<|>A function in F* that increments all integers in a tree)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INCR_NODE<|>EVENT<|>A function in F* that increments the data in a node of a tree)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FOO<|>EVENT<|>A recursive function in F* that demonstrates the use of lexicographic orderings to prove termination)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BAR<|>EVENT<|>A function in F* that works with foo to demonstrate mutual recursion and termination)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FIBONACCI<|>EVENT<|>A function in F* to compute the nth Fibonacci number)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REV<|>EVENT<|>A function in F* to reverse a list)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REV_AUX<|>EVENT<|>A helper function for rev that makes it tail recursive and more efficient)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INCR_TREE<|>INCR_NODE<|>incr_tree and incr_node are mutually recursive functions that depend on each other for incrementing tree structures<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FOO<|>BAR<|>foo and bar are mutually recursive functions demonstrating lexicographic orderings for termination proof<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FIBONACCI<|>FIB<|>fibonacci function uses fib for a more efficient, tail-recursive computation<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>REV<|>REV_AUX<|>rev uses rev_aux to achieve a more efficient, tail-recursive list reversal<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

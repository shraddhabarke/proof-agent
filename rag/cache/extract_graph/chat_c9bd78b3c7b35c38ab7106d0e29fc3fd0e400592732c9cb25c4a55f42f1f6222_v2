Later, you care about some other property about\n``factorial``, e.g., that if ``x > 2`` then ``factorial x > x``. One\noption is to revise the type you wrote for ``factorial`` and get F\\*\nto reprove that it has this type. But this isn't always feasible. What\nif you also wanted to prove that if ``x > 3`` then ``factorial x > 2 *\nx``. Clearly, polluting the type of ``factorial`` with all these\nproperties that you may or may not care about is impractical.\n\nYou could write assertions to ask F* to check these properties, e.g.,\n\n.. code-block:: fstar\n\n   let _ = assert (forall (x:nat). x > 2 ==> factorial x > 2)\n\nBut, F* complains saying that it couldn't prove this fact. That's not\nbecause the fact isn't true—recall, checking the validity of\nassertions in F* is undecidable. So, there are facts that are true\nthat F* may not be able to prove, at least not without some help.\n\nIn this case, proving this property about ``factorial`` requires a\nproof by induction. F* and Z3 cannot do proofs by induction\nautomatically—you will have to help F* here by writing a *lemma*.\n\n\nIntroducing lemmas\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nA lemma is a function in F* that always returns the ``():unit``\nvalue. However, the type of lemma carries useful information about\nwhich facts are provable.\n\nHere's our first lemma:\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Part1.Lemmas.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: factorial_is_positive\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: factorial_is_positive\n\nThere's a lot of information condensed in that definition. Let's spell\nit out in detail:\n\n* ``factorial_is_positive`` is a recursive function with a parameter ``x:nat``\n\n* The return type of ``factorial_is_positive`` is a refinement of\n  unit, namely ``u:unit{factorial x > 0}``.  That says that the\n  function always returns ``()``, but, additionally, when\n  ``factorial_is_positive x`` returns (which it always does, since it\n  is a total function) it is safe to conclude that ``factorial x >\n  0``.\n\n* The next three lines prove the lemma using a proof by induction on\n  ``x``. The basic concept here is that by programming total\n  functions, we can write proofs about other pure expressions. We'll\n  discuss such proofs in detail in the remainder of this section.\n\n.. _Part1_lemma_syntax:\n\nSome syntactic shorthands for Lemmas\n....................................\n\nLemmas are so common in F* that it's convenient to have special syntax\nfor them. Here's another take at our proof by ``factorial x > 0``\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Part1.Lemmas.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: factorial_is_positive_lemma\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: factorial_is_positive_lemma\n\nThe type ``x:t -> Lemma (requires pre) (ensures post)`` is the type of\na function\n\n* that can be called with an argument ``v:t``\n* the argument must satisfies the precondition ``pre[v/x]``\n* the function always returns a ``unit``\n* and ensures that the postcondition ``post[v/x]`` is valid\n\nThe type is equivalent to ``x:t{pre} -> u:unit{post}``.\n\nWhen the precondition ``pre`` is trivial, it can be omitted. One can\njust write:\n\n.. code-block:: fstar\n\n   Lemma (ensures post)\n\nor even\n\n.. code-block:: fstar\n\n   Lemma post\n\n\nA proof by induction, explained in detail\n.........................................\n\nLet's look at this lemma in detail again—why does it convince F* that\n``factorial x > 0``?\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Part1.Lemmas.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: factorial_is_positive_lemma\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: factorial_is_positive_lemma\n\n* It is a proof by induction on ``x``. Proofs by induction in F* are\n  represented by total recursive functions. The fact that it is total\n  is extremely important—it ensures that the inductive argument is\n  well-founded, i.e., that the induction hypothesis is only applied\n  correctly on strictly smaller arguments.\n\n* The base case of the induction is when ``x=0``. In this case, F* +\n  Z3 can easily prove that ``factorial 0 > 0``, since this just\n  requires computing ``factorial 0`` to ``1`` and checking ``1 > 0``.\n\n* What remains is the case where ``x > 0``.\n\n* In the inductive case, the type of the recursively bound\n  ``factorial_is_pos`` represents the induction hypothesis. In this\n  case, its type is\n\n  .. code-block:: fstar\n\n     y:int {y < x} -> Lemma (requires y >= 0) (ensures factorial y > 0)\n\n  In other words, the type\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_c9bd78b3c7b35c38ab7106d0e29fc3fd0e400592732c9cb25c4a55f42f1f6222_v2"}

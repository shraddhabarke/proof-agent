Here f is a term , so if we want to know its\nstructure we must recursively call inspect on it. The a part\nis an argument , consisting of a term and an argument qualifier\n( aqualv ). The qualifier specifies if the application is implicit or\nexplicit.\n\nOf course, in the case of a nested application such as f x y , this\nis nested as (f x) y , so inspecting it would return a Tv_App node containing f x and y (with a Q_Explicit qualifier).\nThere are some helper functions defined to make inspecting applications\neasier, like collect_app , which decompose a term into its “head” and\nall of the arguments the head is applied to.\n\nNow, knowing this, we would then like a function to check if the goal is\na conjunction.\nNaively, we need to inspect the goal to check that it is of the shape squash ((/\\) a1 a2) , that is, an application with two arguments\nwhere the head is the symbol for a conjunction, i.e. (/\\) . This can\nalready be done with the term_view , but is quite inconvenient due to\nthere being too much information in it.\n\nMeta-F* therefore provides another type, formula , to represent logical\nformulas more directly. Hence it suffices for us to call term_as_formula and match on the result, like so:\n\n(* Check if a given term is a conjunction, via term_as_formula. *)\nlet isconj_t (t:term) : Tac bool =\n  match term_as_formula t with\n  | And _ _ -> true\n  | _ -> false\n\n(* Check if the goal is a conjunction. *)\nlet isconj () : Tac bool = isconj_t (cur_goal ())\n\n\nThe term_as_formula function, and all others that work on syntax,\nare defined in “userspace” (that is, as library tactics/metaprograms) by\nusing inspect .\n\nnoeq\ntype formula =\n  | True_  : formula\n  | False_ : formula\n  | And    : term -> term -> formula\n  | Or     : term -> term -> formula\n  | Not    : term -> formula\n  | Implies: term -> term -> formula\n  | Forall : bv -> term -> formula\n  ...\n\n\nNote\n\nFor experts: F* terms are (internally) represented with a\nlocally-nameless representation, meaning that variables do not have\na name under binders, but a de Bruijn index instead. While this has\nmany advantages, it is likely to be counterproductive when doing\ntactics and metaprogramming, hence inspect opens variables when\nit traverses a binder, transforming the term into a fully-named\nrepresentation. This is why inspect is effectul: it requires\nfreshness to avoid name clashes. If you prefer to work with a\nlocally-nameless representation, and avoid the effect label, you can\nuse inspect_ln instead (which will return Tv_BVar nodes instead\nof Tv_Var ones).\n\nDually, a term_view can be transformed into a term via the pack primitive, in order to build the syntax of any term. However,\nit is usually more comfortable to use antiquotations (see above) for\nbuilding terms.\n\n- The smt tactic does not immediately call the SMT solver. It merely\nplaces the current goal into the “SMT Goal” list, all of which are sent\nto the solver when the tactic invocation finishes. If any of these fail,\nthere is currently no way to “try again”.\n\n- If a tactic is natively compiled and loaded as a plugin, editing its\nsource file may not have any effect (it depends on the build\nsystem). You should recompile the tactic, just delete its object\nfile, or use the F* option --no_plugins to run it via the\ninterpreter temporarily,\n\n- When proving a lemma, we cannot just use _ by ... since the expected\ntype is just unit . Workaround: assert the postcondition again,\nor start without any binder.\n\n- Metaprogramming\n\n- Meta arguments and typeclasses\n\n- Plugins (efficient tactics and metaprograms, --codegen Plugin and --load )\n\n- Tweaking the SMT options\n\n- Automated coercions inspect/pack\n\n- e <: C by ...\n\n- Tactics can be used as steps of calc proofs.\n\n- Solving implicits (Steel)\n\n© Copyright 2020, Microsoft Research.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>TV_APP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A node type in a programming context, representing an application of a function to arguments, possibly nested)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Q_EXPLICIT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A qualifier in programming specifying that an application is explicit)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COLLECT_APP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A helper function to decompose a term into its head and the arguments it is applied to)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TERM_VIEW<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A representation of terms that may contain too much information for certain checks)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>META-F*<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A programming tool or environment that provides functionalities for representing logical formulas and other programming tasks)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TERM_AS_FORMULA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A function to check if a term represents a logical formula)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FORMULA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A type representing logical formulas in Meta-F*)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SMT TACTIC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A tactic in programming that prepares goals for the SMT solver without immediately solving them)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MICROSOFT RESEARCH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The organization credited with copyright of the discussed programming concepts)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TV_APP<|>Q_EXPLICIT<|>Tv_App nodes can contain Q_Explicit as a qualifier for applications<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TERM_AS_FORMULA<|>FORMULA<|>Term_as_formula function is used to check if a term matches a logical formula type<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>META-F*<|>FORMULA<|>Meta-F* provides the type formula to represent logical formulas directly<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SMT TACTIC<|>MICROSOFT RESEARCH<|>The SMT tactic, along with other programming concepts, is copyrighted by Microsoft Research<|>4)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

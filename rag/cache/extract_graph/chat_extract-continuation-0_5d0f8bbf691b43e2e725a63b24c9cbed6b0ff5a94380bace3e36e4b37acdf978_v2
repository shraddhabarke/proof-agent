Each of these is an\ninterface file that pairs with a module implementation in a\ncorresponding .fst file.\n\nAn interface ( .fsti ) is very similar to a module implementation\n( .fst ): it can contain all the elements that a module can,\nincluding inductive type definitions; let and let rec definitions; val declarations; etc. However, unlike module\nimplementations, an interface is allowed to declare a symbol val f : t without any corresponding definition of f . This makes f abstract to the rest of the interface and all client modules, i.e., f is simply assumed to have type t without any definition. The\ndefinition of f is provided in the .fst file and checked to\nhave type t , ensuring that a client module’s assumption of f:t is backed by a suitable definition.\n\nTo see how interfaces work, we’ll look at the design of the bounded\ninteger modules FStar.UInt32 , FStar.UInt64 , and the like,\nbuilding our own simplified versions by way of illustration.\n\nThe F* primitive type int is an unbounded mathematical\ninteger. When compiling a program to, say, OCaml, int is compiled\nto a “big integer”, implemented by OCaml’s ZArith package . However, the int type\ncan be inefficient and in some scenarios (e.g., when compiling F*\nto C) one may want to work with bounded integers that can always be\nrepresented in machine word. FStar.UInt32.t and FStar.UInt64.t are types from the standard library whose values can always be\nrepresented as 32- and 64-bit unsigned integers, respectively.\n\nArithmetic operations on 32-bit unsigned integers (like addition) are\ninterpreted modulo 2^32 . However, for many applications, one wants\nto program in a discipline that ensures that there is no unintentional\narithmetic overflow, i.e., we’d like to use bounded integers for\nefficiency, and by proving that their operations don’t overflow we can\nreason about bounded integer terms without using modular arithmetic.\n\nNote\n\nAlthough we don’t discuss them here, F*’s libraries also provide\nsigned integer types that can be compiled to the corresponding\nsigned integters in C. Avoiding overflow on signed integer\narithmetic is not just a matter of ease of reasoning, since signed\ninteger overflow is undefined behavior in C.\n\nThe interface UInt32 begins like any module with the\nmodule’s name. Although this could be inferred from the name of the file\n( UInt32.fsti , in this case), F* requires the name to be explicit.\n\nmodule UInt32\n\nval t : eqtype\n\n\nUInt32 provides one abstract type val t : eqtype , the type of\nour bounded integer. Its type says that it supports decidable\nequality, but no definition of t is revaled in the interface.\n\nThe operations on t are specified in terms of a logical model that\nrelates t to bounded mathematical integers, in particular u32_nat , a natural number less than pow2 32 .\n\nlet n = 32\nlet min : nat = 0\nlet max : nat = pow2 n - 1\nlet u32_nat = n:nat{ n <= max }\n\n\nNote\n\nUnlike interfaces in languages like OCaml, interfaces in F* can include let and let rec definitions. As we see in UInt32 , these definitions are often useful for giving precise\nspecifications to the other operations whose signatures appear in\nthe interface.\n\nTo relate our abstract type t to u32_nat , the interface\nprovides two coercions v and u that go back and forth between t and u32_nat . The lemma signatures vu_inv and uv_inv require v and u to be mutually inverse, meaning\nthat t and u32_nat are in 1-1 correspondence.\n\nval v (x:t) : u32_nat\nval u (x:u32_nat) : t\n\nval uv_inv (x : t) : Lemma (u (v x) == x)\nval vu_inv (x : u32_nat) : Lemma (v (u x) == x)\n\n\nAddition and subtraction on t values are defined modulo pow2 32 . This is specified by the signatures of add_mod and sub_mod below.\n\n(** Addition modulo [2^n]\n\n    Unsigned machine integers can always be added, but the postcondition is now\n    in terms of addition modulo [2^n] on mathematical integers *)\nval add_mod (a:t) (b:t) \n  : y:t { v y = (v a + v b) % pow2 n } \n\n\n(** Subtraction modulo [2^n]\n\n    Unsigned machine integers can always be subtracted, but the postcondition is now\n    in terms of subtraction modulo [2^n] on mathematical integers *)\nval sub_mod (a:t) (b:t) \n  : y:t { v y = (v a - v b) % pow2 n } \n\n\nAlthough precise, the types of add_mod and sub_mod aren’t\nalways easy to reason with. For example, proving that add_mod (u 2) (u 3) == u 5 requires reasoning about modular arithmetic—for\nconstants like 2 , 3 , and 5 this is easy enough, but proofs\nabout modular arithmetic over symbolic values will, in general, involve\nreasoning about non-linear arithmetic, which is difficult to automate\neven with an SMT solver. Besides, in many safety critical software\nsystems, one often prefers to avoid integer overflow altogether.\n\nSo, the UInt32 interface also provides two additional operations, add and sub , whose specification enables two t values to be added\n(resp. subtracted) only if there is no overflow (or underflow).\n\nFirst\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>F* STANDARD LIBRARY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A collection of interface and module implementation files within the F* programming language, specifically located in the ulib folder, dealing with various functionalities including arithmetic operations and type definitions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UINT32<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A module in the F* standard library that provides operations and types for working with 32-bit unsigned integers, ensuring operations like addition and subtraction are performed modulo 2^32 without overflow)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UINT64<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A module in the F* standard library that provides operations and types for working with 64-bit unsigned integers, ensuring operations are performed with considerations for bounded arithmetic to prevent overflow)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OCAML<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A programming language that F* can compile into, specifically using OCaml's ZArith package for big integer implementations)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ZARITH PACKAGE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A package used by OCaml to implement big integers, utilized when F* programs are compiled into OCaml code)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>C<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A programming language that F* can compile into, with considerations for efficiency and avoiding overflow in arithmetic operations)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>UINT32<|>F* STANDARD LIBRARY<|>UInt32 is part of the F* standard library, providing specific functionalities for 32-bit unsigned integers<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>UINT64<|>F* STANDARD LIBRARY<|>UInt64 is part of the F* standard library, providing specific functionalities for 64-bit unsigned integers<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OCAML<|>ZARITH PACKAGE<|>OCaml uses the ZArith package for implementing big integers, which is relevant when F* is compiled to OCaml<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>F* STANDARD LIBRARY<|>OCAML<|>The F* standard library includes functionalities that when compiled are implemented using OCaml's ZArith package for big integers<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>F* STANDARD LIBRARY<|>C<|>The F* standard library includes functionalities that consider efficiency and overflow avoidance when compiled into C<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

An array\nis a contiguous collection of values of the same type. Similar to ref ,\narrays in Pulse can be allocated in the stack frame of the current function\nor in the heap—while the stack allocated arrays are reclaimed automatically\n(e.g., when the function returns), heap allocated arrays are explicitly managed\nby the programmer.\n\nPulse provides two array types: Pulse.Lib.Array.array t as the basic array type\nand Pulse.Lib.Vec.vec t for heap allocated arrays. To provide code reuse, functions\nthat may operate over both stack and heap allocated arrays can be written using Pulse.Lib.Array.array t —the Pulse.Lib.Vec library provides back-and-forth coercions\nbetween vec t and array t .\n\nWe illustrate the basics of array t with the help of the following example\nthat reads an array:\n\nfn read_i\n  (#[@@@ Rust_generics_bounds [\"Copy\"]] t:Type)\n  (arr:array t)\n  (#p:perm)\n  (#s:erased (Seq.seq t))\n  (i:SZ.t { SZ.v i < Seq.length s })\n  requires pts_to arr #p s\n  returns x:t\n  ensures pts_to arr #p s ** pure (x == Seq.index s (SZ.v i))\n{\n  arr.(i)\n}\n\n\nThe library provides a points-to predicate pts_to arr #p s with\nthe interpretation that in the current memory, the contents of arr are same as the (functional) sequence s:FStar.Seq.seq t . Like the pts_to predicate on reference, it is also indexed by an implicit\nfractional permission p , which distinguished shared, read-only\naccess from exclusive read/write access.\n\nIn the arguments of read_i , the argument `s is erased, since\nit is for specification only.\n\nArrays can be read and written-to using indexes of type FStar.SizeT.t , a model of C size_t [ 1 ] in F*, provided that\nthe index is within the array bounds—the refinement SZ.v i < Seq.length s enforces that the index is in bounds, where module SZ = FStar.SizeT . The function returns the i -th element of the\narray, the asserted by the postcondition vprop pure (x == Seq.index s (SZ.v i)) . The body of the function uses the array read operator arr.(i) .\n\nAs another example, let’s write to the i -th element of an array:\n\nfn write_i (#t:Type) (arr:array t) (#s:erased (Seq.seq t)) (x:t) (i:SZ.t { SZ.v i < Seq.length s })\n  requires pts_to arr s\n  ensures pts_to arr (Seq.upd s (SZ.v i) x)\n{\n  arr.(i) <- x\n}\n\n\nThe function uses the array write operator arr(i) <- x and the postcondition\nasserts that in the state when the function returns, the contents of the array\nare same as the sequence s updated at the index i .\n\nWhile any permission suffices for reading, writing requires 1.0R .  For example, implementing write_i without 1.0R is rejected, as shown below.\n\n[@@ expect_failure]\n```pulse\nfn write_ip #t (arr:array t) (#p:perm) (#s:erased _) (x:t) (i:SZ.t { SZ.v i < Seq.length s })\n  requires pts_to arr #p s\n  ensures pts_to arr #p (Seq.upd s (SZ.v i) x)\n{\n  arr.(i) <- x\n}\n```\n\n\nThe library contains share and gather functions, similar to\nthose for references, to divide and combine permissions on arrays.\n\nWe now look at a couple of examples that use arrays with conditionals,\nloops, existentials, and invariants, using many of the Pulse\nconstructs we have seen so far.\n\nsize_t in C is an unsigned integer type that is at least 16 bits wide. The upper bound of size_t is platform\ndependent. FStar.SizeT.size_t models this type and is\nextracted to the primitive size_t type in C, similar to the\nother bounded integer types discussed\npreviously.\n\nLet’s implement a function that compares two arrays for equality:\n\nfn compare\n  (#[@@@ Rust_generics_bounds [\"PartialEq\"; \"Copy\"]] t:eqtype)\n  #p1 #p2\n  (a1 a2:A.array t)\n  (l:SZ.t) \n  requires (\n    A.pts_to a1 #p1 's1 **\n    A.pts_to a2 #p2 's2 **\n    pure (Seq.length 's1 == Seq.length 's2 /\\ Seq.length 's2 == SZ.v l)\n  )\n  returns res:bool\n  ensures (\n    A.pts_to a1 #p1 's1 **\n    A.pts_to a2 #p2 's2 **\n    pure (res <==> Seq.equal 's1 's2)\n  )\n\n\nThe function takes two arrays a1 and a2 as input, and returns a boolean.\nThe postcondition pure (res <==> Seq.equal 's1 's2) specifies that the boolean is true if and only if the sequence representations of the\ntwo arrays are equal. Since the function only reads the arrays, it is parametric in the\npermissions p1 and p2 on the two arrays. Note that the type parameter t has\ntype eqtype , requiring that values of type t support\ndecidable equality.\n\nOne way to implement compare is to use a while loop, reading the two arrays\nusing a mutable counter and checking that the corresponding elements are equal.\n\n{\n  let mut i = 0sz\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PULSE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Pulse is a programming language or framework that provides functionalities for working with mutable arrays, including operations for reading and writing to arrays, and managing permissions and memory.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PULSE.LIB.ARRAY.ARRAY T<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A basic array type in Pulse for creating contiguous collections of values of the same type.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PULSE.LIB.VEC.VEC T<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A type in Pulse for creating heap allocated arrays, which are explicitly managed by the programmer.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FSTAR.SEQ.SEQ T<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A functional sequence type in Pulse, used in specifications to describe the contents of arrays.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FSTAR.SIZET<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A module in Pulse that models the C size_t type, representing an unsigned integer type used for array indexes and bounds.\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PULSE.LIB.ARRAY.ARRAY T<|>PULSE<|>Pulse.Lib.Array.array t is a basic array type provided by Pulse for managing arrays.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PULSE.LIB.VEC.VEC T<|>PULSE<|>Pulse.Lib.Vec.vec t is provided by Pulse for managing heap allocated arrays.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FSTAR.SEQ.SEQ T<|>PULSE<|>FStar.Seq.seq t is used within Pulse to describe the contents of arrays in a functional sequence format.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FSTAR.SIZET<|>PULSE<|>FStar.SizeT is a module in Pulse that models the C size_t type for array indexes and bounds.<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

I.e.,\nfor the body of the function, ``length`` has the following type:\n\n.. code-block:: fstar\n\n   #a:Type -> m:list a{ m << l } -> nat\n\nThis is to say that when using ``length`` to make a recursive call, we\ncan only apply it to an argument ``m << l``, i.e., the recursive call\ncan only be made on an argument ``m`` that precedes the current\nargument ``l``. This is enough to ensure that the recursive calls will\neventually bottom out, since there are no infinite descending chains\nrelated by ``<<``.\n\nIn the case of ``length``, we need to prove at the recursive call\n``length tl`` that ``tl : (m : list a { m << l })``, or, equivalently\nthat ``tl << l`` is valid. But, from the sub-term ordering on\ninductive types, ``l = Cons _ tl``, so ``tl << l`` is indeed provable\nand everything checks out.\n\n.. _Part1_lexicographic_orderings:\n\nLexicographic orderings\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nF* also provides a convenience to enhance the well-founded ordering\n``<<`` to lexicographic combinations of ``<<``. That is, given two\nlists of terms ``v1, ..., vn`` and ``u1, ..., un``, F* accepts that\nthe following lexicographic ordering::\n\n   v1 << u1 ‌‌\\/ (v1 == u1 /\\ (v2 << u2 ‌‌\\/ (v2 == u2 /\\ ( ... vn << un))))\n\nis also well-founded. In fact, it is possible to prove in F* that this\nordering is well-founded, provided ``<<`` is itself well-founded.\n\nLexicographic ordering are common enough that F* provides special\nsupport to make it convenient to use them. In particular, the\nnotation::\n\n   %[v1; v2; ...; vn] << %[u1; u2; ...; un]\n\nis shorthand for::\n\n   v1 << u1 ‌‌\\/ (v1 == u1 /\\ (v2 << u2 ‌‌\\/ (v2 == u2 /\\ ( ... vn << un))))\n\nLet's have a look at lexicographic orderings at work in proving that\nthe classic ``ackermann`` function terminates on all inputs.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Part1.Termination.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: SNIPPET_START: ackermann\n   :end-before: SNIPPET_END: ackermann\n\nThe ``decreases %[m;n]`` syntax tells F* to use the lexicographic\nordering on the pair of arguments ``m, n`` as the measure to prove\nthis function terminating.\n\nWhen defining ``ackermann m n``, for each recursive call of the form\n``ackermann m' n'``, F* checks that ``%[m';n'] << %[m;n]``, i.e., F*\nchecks that either\n\n* ``m' << m``, or\n* ``m' = m`` and ``n' << n``\n\nThere are three recursive calls to consider:\n\n1. ``ackermann (m - 1) 1``: In this case, since we know that ``m >\n   0``, we have ``m - 1 << m``, due to the ordering on natural\n   numbers. Since the ordering is lexicographic, the second argument\n   is irrelevant for termination.\n\n2. ``ackermann m (n - 1)``: In this case, the first argument remained\n   the same (i.e., it's still ``m``), but we know that ``n > 0`` so\n   ``n - 1 << n`` by the natural number ordering.\n\n3. ``ackermann (m - 1) (ackermann m (n - 1))``: Again, like in the\n   first case, the first argument ``m - 1 << m``, and the second is\n   irrelevant for termination.\n\n.. _Part1_termination_default_measures:\n\nDefault measures\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nAs we saw earlier, F* allows you to write the following code, with no\n``decreases`` clause, and it still accepts it.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Part1.Inductives.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: length\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: length\n\nFor that matter, you can leave out the ``decreases`` clause in\n``ackermann`` and F* is okay with it.\n\n.. code-block:: fstar\n\n   let rec ackermann (m n:nat)\n     : nat\n     = if m=0 then n + 1\n       else if n = 0 then ackermann (m - 1) 1\n       else ackermann (m - 1) (ackermann m (n - 1))\n\nThis is because F* uses a simple heuristic to choose the decreases\nclause, if the user didn't provide one.\n\nThe *default* decreases clause for a total, recursive function is the\nlexicographic ordering of all the non-function-typed arguments, taken\nin\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

That is, the two constructors build different instances of\n``vec``---those instances have the same parameter (``a``), but\ndifferent indexes (``0`` and ``n + 1``).\n\n.. note::\n\n   Datatypes in many languages in the ML family, including OCaml and\n   F#, have parameters but no indexes. So, all the data construtors\n   construct the same instance of the type constructor. Further, all\n   data constructors take at most one argument. If your datatype\n   happens to be simple enough to fit these restrictions, you can use\n   a notation similar to OCaml or F# for those types in F*. For\n   example, here's the ``option`` type defined in F* using an\n   OCaml-like notation.\n\n   .. code-block:: fstar\n\n      type option a =\n        | None\n        | Some of a\n\n   This is equivalent to\n\n   .. code-block:: fstar\n\n      type option a =\n        | None : option a\n        | Some : a -> option a\n\nGetting an element from a vector\n................................\n\nWith our length-indexed ``vec`` type, one can write functions with\ntypes that make use of the length information to ensure that they are\nwell-defined. For example, to get the ``i`` th element of a vector, one\ncan write:\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Vec.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: long_get\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: long_get\n\nThe type of ``get i v`` says that ``i`` must be less than ``n``, where\n``n`` is the length of ``v``, i.e., that ``i`` is within bounds of the\nvector, which is enough to prove that ``get i v`` can always return an\nelement of type ``a``. Let's look a bit more closely at how this\nfunction is typechecked by F*.\n\nThe first key bit is pattern matching ``v``:\n\n.. code-block:: fstar\n\n   match v with\n   | Nil -> false_elim()\n   | Cons hd tl ->\n\nIn case ``v`` is ``Nil``, we use the library function\n``Prims.false_elim : squash False -> a`` to express that this case is\nimpossible. Intuitively, since the index ``i`` is a natural number\nstrictly less than the length of the list, we should be able to\nconvince F* that ``n <> 0``.\n\nThe way this works is that F* typechecks the branch in a context that\nincludes an *equation*, namely that the ``v : vec a n`` equals the\npattern ``Nil : vec a 0``. With the assumption that ``v == Nil`` in\nthe context, F* tries to check that ``false_elim`` is well-typed,\nwhich in turn requires ``() : squash False``. This produces an proof\nobligation sent to the SMT solver, which is able to prove ``False`` in\nthis case, since from ``v = Nil`` we must have that ``n = 0`` which\ncontradicts ``i < n``. Put another way, the branch where ``v = Nil``\nis unreachable given the precondition ``i < n``.\n\n.. note::\n\n   When a branch is unreachable, F* allows you to just omit the branch\n   altogether, rather than writing it an explicitly calling\n   ``false_elim``. For example, it is more common to write:\n\n   .. literalinclude:: ../code/Vec.fst\n      :language: fstar\n      :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: get\n      :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: get\n\n   where ``let Cons hd tl = v`` pattern matches ``v`` against just\n   ``Cons hd tl``. F* automatically proves that the other cases of\n   the match are unreachable.\n\nNow, turning to the second case, we have a pattern like this:\n\n.. code-block:: fstar\n\n   match v with\n   | Cons hd tl ->\n\nBut, recall that ``Cons`` has an implicit first argument describing\nthe length of ``tl``. So, more explicitly, our pattern is of the form\nbelow, where ``tl : vec a m``.\n\n.. code-block:: fstar\n\n   match v with\n   | Cons #m hd tl ->\n\nF* typechecks the branch in a context that includes the equation that\n``v == Cons #m hd tl``, which lets the solve conclude that ``n == m +\n1``, from the type of ``Cons``.\n\nIf ``i=0``, we've found the element we want and return it.\n\nOtherwise, we make a recursive call ``get (i - 1) tl`` and now F* has\nto:\n\n  * Instantiate the implicit argument of ``get`` to ``m``, the length\n    of ``tl``. That is, in explicit form, this recursive call is\n    really ``get #m (i - 1) tl``. F* does this by relying on a\n    unification algorithm implemented as part of its type inference\n    procedure.\n\n  * Prove that ``(i - 1) < m``, which follows from ``i < n`` and ``n\n    == m + 1``.\n\n  * Prove that the recursive call terminates, by proving that ``m <<\n    n``, or, equivalently, since ``m`` and ``n`` are natural numbers,\n    ``m < n``. This is easy, since we have ``n == m + 1``.\n\nLet's try a few exercises.

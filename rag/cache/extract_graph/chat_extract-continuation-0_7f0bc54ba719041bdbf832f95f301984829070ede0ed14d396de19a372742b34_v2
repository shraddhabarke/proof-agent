writing some real\ncode, starting with a function to compute the length of an llist .\n\nfn rec length (#t:Type0) (x:llist t)\nrequires is_list x 'l\nreturns n:nat\nensures is_list x 'l ** pure (n ==

rewrite each _node as node;\n      let n = length node.tail;\n      intro_is_list_cons x vl;\n      (1 + n)\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\nThe None case is simple.\n\nSome points to note in the Some case:\n\n- We use with _node _tl. _ to “get our hands on” the\nexistentially bound witnesses.\n\n- After reading let node = !vl , we need is_list node.tail _tl to make the recursive call. But the context contains is_list _node.tail _tl and node == _node . So, we need a\nrewrite.\n\n- We re-introduce the is_list predicate, and return 1 + n . While the intro_is_list_cons x vl is a ghost step and\nwill be erased before execution, the addition is not—so, this\nfunction is not tail recursive.\n\nWrite a tail-recursive version of length .\n\nIndex the is_list predicate with a fractional permission.  Write\nghost functions to share and gather fractional is_list predicates.\n\nWhat if we wanted to implement length using a while loop, as is\nmore idiomatic in a language like C. It will take us a few steps to\nget there, and we’ll use the trade operator ( @==> ) to structure\nour proof.\n\nOur first step is to define tail_for_cons , a lemma stating that with\npermission on a node pointer ( pts_to v n ), we can build a trade\ntransforming a permission on the tail into a permission for a cons\ncell starting at the given node.\n\nghost\nfn tail_for_cons (#t:Type) (v:node_ptr t) (#n:node t) (tl:erased (list t))\nrequires \n  pts_to v n\nensures \n  (is_list n.tail tl @==> is_list (Some v) (n.head::tl))\n{\n  ghost\n  fn aux ()\n  requires \n    pts_to v n ** is_list n.tail tl\n  ensures \n    is_list (Some v) (n.head::tl)\n  {\n    intro_is_list_cons (Some v) v\n  };\n  I.intro _ _ _ aux;\n}\n\n\nNext, here’s a basic operation on a linked list: given a pointer to a\ncons cell, return a pointer to its tail. Here’s a small diagram:\n\nx             tl\n|             |\nv             v\n.---.---.     .---.---.\n|   | --|---> |   | --|--> ...\n.---.---.     .---.---.\n\n\nWe’re given a pointer x to the cons cell at the head of a list,\nand we want to return tl , the pointer to the next cell (or None , of x this is the end of the list). But, if we want to return\na pointer to tl , we a permission accounting problem:\n\n- We cannot return permission to x to the caller, since then we\nwould have two aliases pointing to the next cell in the list:\nthe returned tl and x -> next .\n\n- But, we cannot consume the permission to x either, since we\nwould like to return permission to x once the return tl goes out of scope.\n\nThe solution here is to use a trade. The type of tail below says\nthat if x is a non-null pointer satisfying is_list x 'l , then tail returns a pointer y such that is_list y tl (where tl is the tail of 'l ); and, one can trade is_list y tl to\nrecover permission to is_list x 'l . The trade essentially says\nthat you cannot have permission to is_list x 'l and is_list y tl at the same time, but once you give up permission on y , you\ncan get back the original permission on x .\n\nfn tail (#t:Type) (x:llist t)\nrequires is_list x 'l ** pure (Some? x)\nreturns y:llist t\nensures exists* tl.\n    is_list y tl **\n    (is_list y tl @==> is_list x 'l)\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>IS_LIST_CASE_NONE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A ghost function that handles the case when a linked list is empty, ensuring the list remains unchanged and is indeed empty)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IS_LIST_CASE_SOME<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A ghost function that deals with the non-empty case of a linked list, ensuring the list structure is maintained and correctly represents the list's contents)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LENGTH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A function to compute the length of a linked list, demonstrating both base and recursive cases for empty and non-empty lists respectively)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TAIL_FOR_CONS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A lemma stating that with permission on a node pointer, one can transform a permission on the list's tail into a permission for the entire list)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TAIL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A function that, given a pointer to a list's cons cell, returns a pointer to its tail, managing permissions to ensure no aliasing issues arise)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>IS_LIST_CASE_SOME<|>LENGTH<|>IS_LIST_CASE_SOME is utilized within the LENGTH function to handle non-empty list cases<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>IS_LIST_CASE_NONE<|>LENGTH<|>IS_LIST_CASE_NONE is utilized within the LENGTH function to handle the empty list case<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TAIL_FOR_CONS<|>TAIL<|>TAIL_FOR_CONS provides the necessary permission transformation logic used in the TAIL function<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

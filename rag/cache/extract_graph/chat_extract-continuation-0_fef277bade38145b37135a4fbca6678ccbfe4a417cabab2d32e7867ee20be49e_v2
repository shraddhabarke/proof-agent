A type system for the simply-typed lambda calculus is\ndesigned to prevent this kind of runtime error.\n\nThe type system is an inductively defined relation ``typing g e t``\nbetween a\n\n  * typing environment ``g:env``, a partial map from variable indexes\n    in a particular scope to their annotated types;\n\n  * a program expression ``e:exp``;\n\n  * and its type ``t:typ``.\n\nEnvironments\n------------\n\nThe code below shows our representation of typing environments\n``env``, a total function from variable indexes ``var`` to ``Some t``\nor ``None``.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Part2.STLC.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: env$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: env$\n\n* The ``empty`` environment maps all variables to ``None``.\n\n* Extending an an environment ``g`` associating a type ``t`` with a\n  new variable at index ``0`` involves shifting up the indexes of all\n  other variables in ``g`` by ``1``.\n\n.. _Part2_stlc_typing:\n\nTyping Relation\n---------------\n\nThe type system of STLC is defined by the inductively defined relation\n``typing g e t`` shown below. A value of ``typing g e t`` is a\nderivation, or a proof, that ``e`` has type ``t`` in the environment\n``g``.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Part2.STLC.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: typing$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: typing$\n\n* The type does not support decidable equality, since all its\n  constructors contain a field ``g:env``, a function-typed value\n  without decidable equality. So, we mark the inductive with the\n  ``noeq`` qualifier, :ref:`as described previously\n  <Part2_equality_qualifiers>`.\n\n* ``TyUnit`` says that the unit value ``EUnit`` has type ``TUnit`` in\n  all environments.\n\n* ``TyVar`` says that a variable ``x`` is well-typed only in an\n  environment ``g`` that binds its type to ``Some t``, in which case,\n  the program ``EVar x`` has type ``t``. This rule ensures that no\n  out-of-scope variables can be used.\n\n* ``TyLam`` says that a function literal ``ELam t e1`` has type ``TArr\n  t t'`` in environment ``g``, when the body of the function ``e1``\n  has type ``t'`` in an environment that extends ``g`` with a binding\n  for the new variable at type ``t`` (while shifting and retaining all\n  other ariables).\n\n* Finally, ``TyApp`` allows applying ``e1`` to ``e2`` only when ``e1``\n  has an arrow type and the argument ``e2`` has the type of the formal\n  parameter of ``e1``---the entire term has the return type of ``e1``.\n\nProgress\n++++++++\n\nIt's relatively easy to prove that a well-typed non-unit or lambda\nterm with no free variables can take a single step of\ncomputation.

This property is known as *preservation* (or\nsometimes *subject reduction*). When taken in combination with\n*progress*, this allows us to show that a well-typed term can keep\ntaking a step until it reaches a value.\n\nThe proof below establishes preservation for a single step.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Part2.STLC.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: preservation_step$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: preservation_step$\n\n* Since we know the computation takes a step, the typing derivation\n  ``ht`` must be an instance of ``TyApp``.\n\n* In the ``AppLeft`` and ``AppRight`` case, we can easily use the\n  induction hypothesis depending on which side actually stepped.\n\n* The ``Beta`` case is the most interesting and requires a lemma about\n  substitutions preserving typing.\n\nThe substitution lemma follows:\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Part2.STLC.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: substitution$\n   :end-before\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>STLC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>STLC refers to the Simply-Typed Lambda Calculus, a formal system in mathematical logic and computer science for describing computation in terms of function abstraction and application using variable binding and substitution)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TUNIT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>TUnit is a type in STLC representing the unit type, which is the type with exactly one value and used where no other value is expected)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EUNIT<|>PERSON<|>EUnit is the unit value in STLC, representing an expression that evaluates to the unit type)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TYVAR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>TyVar is a rule in STLC's type system that deals with variable types, ensuring variables are well-typed within their scope)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TYLAM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>TyLam is a rule in STLC's type system for typing lambda expressions, ensuring functions have a proper type declaration)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TYAPP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>TyApp is a rule in STLC's type system that allows function application, ensuring that functions are applied to arguments of the correct type)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ENV<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Env represents typing environments in STLC, mapping variable indexes to their types to ensure variables are used within their scope)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TYLAM<|>ENV<|>TyLam involves extending an environment with a new variable binding to type lambda expressions<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TYVAR<|>ENV<|>TyVar ensures a variable is well-typed only if its type is bound in the environment<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TYAPP<|>TYLAM<|>TyApp applies a function typed by TyLam to an argument, requiring the function to have an arrow type<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TYAPP<|>TYVAR<|>TyApp can apply a function to a variable whose type is ensured by TyVar<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

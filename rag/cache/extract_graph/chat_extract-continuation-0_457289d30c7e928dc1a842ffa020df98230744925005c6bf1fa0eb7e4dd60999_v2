What we really\nneed is a universal quantifier.\n\nHere’s the right version of regain_half :\n\nlet regain_half_q #a (x:GR.ref a) =\n  forall* u. pts_to x #0.5R u @==> pts_to x u \n\n\nThis says that no matter what pts_to x #one_half u the context\nhas, they can recover full permission to it, with the same witness u .\n\nThe forall* quantifier and utilities to manipulate it are defined\nin Pulse.Lib.Forall.Util . The introduction and elimination forms\nhave a similar shape to what we saw earlier for @==> :\n\nghost\nfn FA.elim (#a:Type) (#p:a->vprop) (v:a)\nrequires (forall* x. p x)\nensures p v\n\n\nThe eliminator allows a single instantiation of the universally\nbound x to v .\n\nghost\nfn FA.intro (#a:Type) (#p:a->vprop)\n     (v:vprop)\n     (f_elim : (x:a -> stt_ghost unit emp_inames v (fun _ -> p x)))\nrequires v\nensures (forall* x. p x)\n\n\nThe introduction form requires proving that one holds v , and that\nwith v a ghost function can produce p x , for any x .\n\nNote, it’s very common to have universal quantifiers and trades\ntogether, so the library also provides the following combined forms:\n\nghost\nfn elim_forall_imp (#a:Type0) (p q: a -> vprop) (x:a)\nrequires (forall* x. p x @==> q x) ** p x\nensures q x\n\n\nand\n\nghost\nfn intro_forall_imp (#a:Type0) (p q: a -> vprop) (r:vprop)\n         (elim: (u:a -> stt_ghost unit emp_inames\n                          (r ** p u)\n                          (fun _ -> q u)))\nrequires r\nensures forall* x. p x @==> q x\n\n\nHere’s how one introduces regain_half_q :\n\nghost \nfn intro_regain_half_q (x:GR.ref int)\nrequires pts_to x 'v\nensures pts_to x #0.5R 'v ** regain_half_q x\n{\n  ghost\n  fn aux1 (u:int)\n  requires pts_to x #0.5R 'v ** pts_to x #0.5R u\n  ensures pts_to x u\n  {\n    gather x;\n  };\n  GR.share x;\n  FA.intro_forall_imp _ _ _ aux1;\n  fold regain_half_q;\n}\n\n\nNow, when we want to use it, we can trade in any half-permission on pts_to x #one_half u , for a full permission with the same u .\n\nghost\nfn use_regain_half_q (x:GR.ref int)\nrequires pts_to x #0.5R 'u ** regain_half_q x\nensures pts_to x 'u\n{\n  unfold regain_half_q;\n  FA.elim #_ #(fun u -> pts_to x #0.5R u @==> pts_to x u) 'u;\n  I.elim _ _;\n}\n\n\nNote using the eliminator for FA.elim is quite verbose: we need to\nspecify the quantifier term again. The way Pulse uses F*’s unifier\ncurrently does not allow it to properly find solutions to some\nhigher-order unification problems. We expect to fix this soon.\n\nAs a final example in this section, we show that one can use package\nany ghost computation into a trade, including steps that may modify\nthe ghost state.

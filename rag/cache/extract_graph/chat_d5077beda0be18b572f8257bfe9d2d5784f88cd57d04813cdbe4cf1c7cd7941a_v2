In this example, rather\nthan going via the indirection of the syntax of lambda terms, we show\nhow the type dyn can be used directly to embed within F* a small\nTuring complete, dynamically typed programming language.\n\nWe can start by lifting the F* operations on integers and functions to\n(possibly failing) operations on dyn .\n\n(* Lifting operations on integers to operations on dyn *)\nlet lift (op: int -> int -> int) (n m:dyn) : dyn\n  = match n, m with\n    | DInt i, DInt j -> DInt (op i j)\n    | _ -> DErr \"Expected integers\"\nlet mul = lift op_Multiply\nlet sub = lift op_Subtraction\nlet add = lift op_Addition\nlet div (n m:dyn)\n  = match n, m with\n    | DInt i, DInt j -> \n      if j = 0 then DErr \"Division by zero\"\n      else DInt (i / j)\n    | _ -> DErr \"Expected integers\"\nlet mod (n m:dyn)\n  = match n, m with\n    | DInt i, DInt j -> \n      if j = 0 then DErr \"Division by zero\"\n      else DInt (i % j)\n    | _ -> DErr \"Expected integers\"\n\n\nWe also encode provide operations to compare dyn-typed integers and to\nbranch on them, treating 0 as false .\n\n(* Branching *)\nlet if_ (d:dyn) (then_ else_:dyn) =\n  match d with\n  | DInt b -> \n    if b<>0 then then_ else else_\n  | _ -> DErr \"Can only branch on integers\"\n\n(* comparison *)\nlet eq_ (d:dyn) (d':dyn)\n  : dyn \n  = match d, d' with\n    | DInt i, DInt j -> DInt (if i = j then 1 else 0)\n    | _ -> DErr \"Can only compare integers\"\n\n\nFor functions, we can provide combinators to apply functions and,\nimportantly, a combinator fix that provides general recursion.\n\n(* Dynamically typed application *)\nlet app (f:dyn) (x:dyn)\n  : Dv dyn\n  = match f with\n    | DFun f -> f x\n    | _ -> DErr \"Can only apply a function\"\n(* general recursion *)\nlet rec fix (f: (dyn -> Dv dyn) -> dyn -> Dv dyn) (n:dyn)\n  : Dv dyn\n  = f (fix f) n\n\n\nAn aside on the arity of recursive functions: You may wonder why fix is defined as shown, rather than fix_alt below, which\nremoves a needless additional abstraction. The reason is that with fix_alt , to instruct F* to disable the termination checker on the\nrecursive definition, we need an additional Dv annotation: indeed,\nevaluating fixalt f in a call-by-value semantics would result,\nunconditionally, in an infinite loop, whereas fix f would\nimmediately return the lambda term fun n -> f (fix f) n . In other\nwords, eta reduction (or removing redundant function applications)\ndoes not preserve semantics in the presence of divergence.\n\nlet rec fix_alt (f: (dyn -> Dv dyn) -> dyn -> Dv dyn) \n  : Dv (dyn -> Dv dyn)\n  = f (fix_alt f)\n\n\nWith that, we can program non-trivial dynamically typed, general\nrecursive programs within F* itself, as seen below.\n\n(* shorthands *)\nlet i (i:int) : dyn = DInt i\nlet lam (f:dyn -> Dv dyn) : dyn = DFun f\n(* a dynamically typed analog of collatz *)\nlet collatz_dyn \n  : dyn \n  = lam (fix (fun collatz n ->\n                if_ (eq_ n (i 1))\n                    (i 1)\n                    (if_ (eq_ (mod n (i 2)) (i 0))\n                         (collatz (div n (i 2)))\n                         (collatz (add (mul n (i 3)) (i 1))))))\n\n\nAll of which is to illustrate that with general recursion and\nnon-positive datatypes using Dv , F* is a general-purpose\nprogramming language like ML, Haskell, Lisp, or Scheme, or other\nfunctional languages you may be familiar with.\n\n© Copyright 2020, Microsoft Research.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_d5077beda0be18b572f8257bfe9d2d5784f88cd57d04813cdbe4cf1c7cd7941a_v2"}

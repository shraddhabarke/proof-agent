In the first example above, F* figures out that the instance\nneeded is ``printable_list printable_int : printable (list\nint)``. Note, you can always pass the typeclass instance you want\nexplicitly, if you really want to, as the second example ``_ex2``\nabove shows.\n\nIn many cases, the implicit typeclass argument need not be named, in\nwhich case one can just omit the name and write:\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Typeclasses.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: print_any_list_alt$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: print_any_list_alt$\n\nUnder the hood\n..............\n\nWhen defining a ``class``, F* automatically generates generic\nfunctions corresponding to the methods of the class. For instance, in\nthe case of ``printable``, F* generates:\n\n.. code-block:: fstar\n\n   let to_string #a {| i : printable a |} (x:a) = i.to_string x\n\nHaving this in scope overloads ``to_string`` for all instance of the\n``printable`` class. In the implementation of ``to_string``, we use\nthe instance ``i`` (just a record, sometimes called a dictionary in\nthe typeclass literature) and project its ``to_string`` field and\napply it to ``x``.\n\nDefining an ``instance p x1..xn : t = e`` is just\nlike an ordinary let binding ``let p x1..xn : t = e``, however the\n``instance`` keyword instructs F*'s type inference algorithm to\nconsider using ``p`` when trying to instantiate implicit arguments\nfor typeclass instances.\n\nFor example, at the call site ``to_string (x:bool)``, having unified\nthe implicit type arguments ``a`` with ``bool``, what remains is to\nfind an instance of ``printable bool``. F* looks through the current\ncontext for all variable bindings in the local scope, and ``instance``\ndeclarations in the top-level scope, for a instance of ``printable\nbool``, taking the first one it is able to construct.\n\nThe resolution procedure for ``to_string [[1;2;3]]`` is a bit more\ninteresting, since we need to find an instance ``printable (list\nint)``, although no such ground instance exists. However, the\ntypeclass resolution procedure finds the ``printable_list`` instance\nfunction, whose result type ``printable (list a)`` matches the goal\n``printable (list int)``, provided ``a = int``. The resolution\nprocedure then spawns a sub-goal ``printable int``, which it solves\neasily and completes the derivation of ``printable (list int)``.\n\nThis backwards, goal-directed search for typeclass resolution is a\nkind of logic programming. An interesting implementation detail is\nthat most of the typeclass machinery is defined as a metaprogran in\n``FStar.Tactics.Typeclasses``, outside of the core of F*'s\ncompiler. As such, the behavior of typeclass resolution is entirely\nuser-customizable, simply by revising the metaprogram in use. Some\ndetails about how this works can be found in a paper on `Meta F*\n<http://fstar-lang.org/papers/metafstar/>`_.\n\nExercises\n.........\n\nDefine instances of ``printable`` for ``string``, ``a & b``, ``option\na``, and ``either a b``. Check that you can write ``to_string [Inl (0,\n1); Inr (Inl (Some true)); Inr (Inr \"hello\") ]`` and have F* infer the\ntypeclass instance needed.\n\nAlso write the typeclass instances you need explicitly, just to check\nthat you understand how things work. This is exercise should also\nconvey that typeclasses do not increase the expressive power in any\nway---whatever is expressible with typeclasses, is also expressible by\nexplicitly passing records that contain the operations needed on\nspecific type parameters. However, expliciting passing this operations\ncan quickly become overwhelming---typeclass inference keeps this\ncomplexity in check and makes it possible to build programs in an\ngeneric, abstract style without too much pain.\n\nThis `exercise file <../code/exercises/Part3.Typeclasses.fst>`_ provides\nthe definitions you need.\n\n.. container:: toggle\n\n    .. container:: header\n\n       **Answer**\n\n    .. literalinclude:: ../code/Typeclasses.fst\n       :language: fstar\n       :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: print_answer$\n       :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: print_answer$\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBounded Unsigned Integers\n-------------------------\n\nThe ``printable`` typeclass is fairly standard and can be defined in\nalmost any language that supports typeclasses. We now turn to a\ntypeclass that leverages F*'s dependent types by generalizing the\ninterface of bounded unsigned integers that we developed in a\n:ref:`previous chapter <Part3_interfaces>`.\n\nA type ``a`` is in the class ``bounded_unsigned_int``, when it\nadmits:\n\n  * An element ``bound : a``, representing the maximum value\n\n  * A pair of functions ``from_nat`` and ``to_nat\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I'm sorry, but without a specific text related to the instructions provided, I cannot generate the entities and relationships as requested.

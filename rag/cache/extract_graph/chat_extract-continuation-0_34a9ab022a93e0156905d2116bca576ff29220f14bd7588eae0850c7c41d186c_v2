The encoding is \"deep\" in the sense that\nwe used an inductive type to represent the *syntax* of the lambda\ncalculus in F*, and then defined and proved some properties of its\nsemantics represented mathematically in F*.\n\nAnother way to embed a language like the STLC in F* is a *shallow\nembedding*. F* is itself a functional programming language, and it has\na type system that is certainly powerful enough to represent simply\ntyped terms, so why not use lambda terms in F* itself to represent\nSTLC, rather than merely encoding STLC's abstract syntax in F*. This\nkind of encoding is called a shallow embedding, where we use semantic\nconstructs in the host (or meta) language (F*) to represent analogous\nfeatures of the embedded (or object) language (STLC, in our example).\n\nIn this chapter, we look at a particularly elegant technique for doing\nthis called *higher-order abstract syntax* (or HOAS). For more\nbackground about this, a `2008 paper by Adam Chlipala\n<http://adam.chlipala.net/papers/PhoasICFP08/PhoasICFP08.pdf>`_ is a\ngood resource, though it develops a more sophisticated parametric\nversion.\n\nOur small case study in HOAS is meant to illustrate the use of\ninductive types with non-trivial indexes while also containing\nstrictly positive functions as arguments, and also a bit of type-level\ncomputation.\n\nRoadmap\n+++++++\n\nThe type ``typ`` below represents the types we'll use in our STLC\nobject language, i.e., the base types ``Bool`` and ``Int``, and\nfunction types ``Arrow t1 t2``.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Part2.HOAS.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: typ$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: typ$\n\nThis is analogous to our representation of STLC types in the deep\nembedding of the previous chapter.\n\nWhere things get interesting is in the representation of STLC terms\nand their semantics. To set the goal posts, we want to\n\n  1. Give an interpretation of STLC types into F* types, by defining a\n     function ``denote_typ : typ -> Type``\n\n  2. Define a type ``term t``, to represent well-typed STLC\n     terms whose type is ``t:typ``\n\n  3. Give an intepretation of STLC terms in to F* terms of the\n     suitable type, i.e., define a function ``denote_term (#t:typ)\n     (e:term t) : denote_typ t``, proving that every well-typed STLC\n     term at type ``t`` can be represented in F* as a function of type\n     ``denote_typ t``.\n\nSuch a result would encompass the type soundness results we proved in\nthe previous chapter (proving that well-typed programs can always make\nprogress), but would go substantially further to show that the\nreduction of all such terms always terminates producing F* values that\nmodel their semantics.\n\n.. _Part2_phoas_denotation:\n\nDenotation of types\n+++++++++++++++++++\n\nStep 1 in our roadmap is to give an interpreration of STLC types\n``typ`` into F* types. This is easily done, as shown below.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Part2.HOAS.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: denote_typ$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: denote_typ$\n\nWe have here a recursive function that computes a *Type* from its\nargument. This is may seem odd at first, but it's perfectly legal in a\ndependently typed language like F*.\n\nThe function ``denote_typ`` The interpretation of ``Bool`` and ``Int``\nare the F* type ``bool`` and ``int``, while the interpretation of\n``Arrow`` is an F* arrow. Note, the function terminates because the\ntwo recursive calls are on strict sub-terms of the argument.\n\n\nTerm representation\n++++++++++++++++++++\n\nThe main difficulty in representing a language like STLC (or any\nlanguage with lambda-like variable-binding structure), is the question\nof how to represent variables and their binders.\n\nIn the deep embedding of the previous chapter, our answer to this\nquestions was very syntactic---variables are de Bruijn indexes, where,\nat each occurrence, the index used for a variable counts the number of\nlambdas to traverse to reach the binder for that variable.\n\nThe HOAS approach to answering these questions is very different. The\nidea is to use the binding constructs and variables already available\nin the host language (i.e., lambda terms in F*) to represent binders\nand variables in the object language (STLC).\n\nThe main type in our representation of terms is the ``term`` defined\nbelow. There are several clever subtleties here, which we'll try to\nexplain briefly.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Part2.HOAS.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: term$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: term$\n\nFirst, the ``term`` type represents both the abstract syntax of the\nSTLC as well as its typing rules. We'll see in detail how this works,\nbut notice already that ``term`` is is indexed by a ``\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>STLC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Simply Typed Lambda Calculus, a formal system in mathematical logic and computer science for expressing computation based on function abstraction and application using typed variables)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>F*<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A functional programming language designed at Microsoft Research, used here to represent and work with STLC through both deep and shallow embeddings)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ADAM CHLIPALA<|>PERSON<|>Author of a 2008 paper discussing higher-order abstract syntax and its applications in programming language theory)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BOOL<|>GEO<|>A base type in STLC representing boolean values, true or false)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INT<|>GEO<|>A base type in STLC representing integer values)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ARROW<|>GEO<|>A function type in STLC representing functions from one type to another)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STLC<|>F*<|>STLC is represented and analyzed within the F* programming language through embeddings<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ADAM CHLIPALA<|>STLC<|>Adam Chlipala discussed advanced techniques for representing STLC, contributing to its understanding and application<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BOOL<|>STLC<|>Bool is a base type used within STLC for logical operations<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INT<|>STLC<|>Int is a base type used within STLC for arithmetic operations<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARROW<|>STLC<|>Arrow represents function types in STLC, crucial for its lambda calculus foundations<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

Specifically, the predicate\n   `wfr.relation x1 x2` means that `x1` precedes `x2` in the\n   well-founded relation described by `wfr`.\n\n   You can then use this relatedness to show that a function is\n   decreasing in a certain term. Whenever `wfr.relation x1 x2` holds,\n   `wfr.decreaser x1 << wfr.decreaser x2` also holds. The library has\n   an ambient lemma triggered by seeing two instances of\n   `wfr.decreaser`, so you can use `wfr.decreaser x` in your decreases\n   clause. For example:\n\n     // Define `nat_nat_wfr` to represent the lexicographically-precedes\n     // relation between two elements of type `nat * nat`. That is,\n     // `(x1, y1)` is related to `(x2, y2)` if\n     // `x1 < x2 \\/ (x1 == x2 /\\ y1 < y2)`.\n\n     let nat_nat_wfr = lex_nondep_wfr (default_wfr nat) (default_wfr nat)\n\n     // To show that `f` is well-defined, we use the decreases clause\n     // `nat_nat_wfr.decreaser (x, y)`. We then need to show, on each\n     // recursive call, that the parameters x2 and y2 to the nested\n     // call satisfy `nat_nat_wfr.relation (x2, y2) (x, y)`.\n\n     let rec f (x: nat) (y: nat)\n       : Tot nat (decreases (nat_nat_wfr.decreaser (x, y))) =\n       if x = 0 then\n         0\n       else if y = 0 then (\n         // This assertion isn't necessary; it's just for illustration\n         assert (nat_nat_wfr.relation (x - 1, 100) (x, y));\n         f (x - 1) 100\n       )\n       else (\n         // This assertion isn't necessary; it's just for illustration\n         assert (nat_nat_wfr.relation (x, y - 1) (x, y));\n         f x (y - 1)\n       )\n\n  One way `wfr_t` can be useful is that it simplifies debugging when\n  the SMT solver can't verify termination. You can assert the\n  relation explicitly (as in the examples above), and if the assertion\n  doesn't hold you can try to prove it. If you instead use something\n  like `decreases %[x, y]`, it's harder to debug because you can't\n  `assert (%[x2, y2] << %[x, y])`.\n\n  But where `wfr_t` is most useful is in writing a function that takes\n  a well-founded relation as input. Here's an illustrative example:\n\n    let rec count_steps_to_none\n      (#a: Type)\n      (wfr: wfr_t a)\n      (stepper: (x: a) -> (y: option a{Some? y ==> wfr.relation (Some?.v y) x}))\n      (start: option a)\n      : Tot nat (decreases (option_wfr wfr).decreaser start) =\n      match start with\n      | None -> 0\n      | Some x -> 1 + count_steps_to_none wfr stepper (stepper x)\n\n  `wfr_t` is also useful when composing a well-founded relation\n  produced using `acc` (from the FStar.WellFounded library) with one\n  or more other well-founded relations.\n\n  There are a few ways to build a `wfr_t`, described in more detail in\n  comments throughout this file. Those ways are:\n\n    `default_wfr a`\n    `empty_wfr a`\n    `acc_to_wfr r f`\n    `subrelation_to_wfr r wfr`\n    `inverse_image_to_wfr r f wfr`\n    `lex_nondep_wfr wfr_a wfr_b`\n    `lex_dep_wfr wfr_a a_to_wfr_b`\n    `bool_wfr`\n    `option_wfr wfr`\n*)\n\nmodule FStar.WellFoundedRelation\n\nnoeq type acc_classical (#a: Type u#a) (r: a -> a -> Type0) (x: a) : Type u#a =\n  | AccClassicalIntro : access_smaller:(y: a{r y x} -> acc_classical r y) -> acc_classical r x\n\nnoeq type wfr_t (a: Type u#a) : Type u#(a + 1) =\n  {\n    relation: a -> a -> Type0;\n    decreaser: (x: a ->\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MICROSOFT RESEARCH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An organization where Jay Lorch and Nikhil Swamy are associated and which holds the copyright for the discussed library>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JAY LORCH<|>PERSON<|>Co-author of the library intended to simplify using well-founded relations in decreases clauses, associated with Microsoft Research)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NIKHIL SWAMY<|>PERSON<|>Co-author of the library intended to simplify using well-founded relations in decreases clauses, associated with Microsoft Research)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>APACHE LICENSE, VERSION 2.0<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The license under which the library is distributed, allowing use, modification, and distribution under certain conditions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FSTAR.WELLFOUNDEDRELATION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The module within the library that encapsulates functionalities related to well-founded relations)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JAY LORCH<|>MICROSOFT RESEARCH<|>Jay Lorch is associated with Microsoft Research as a co-author of the library<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NIKHIL SWAMY<|>MICROSOFT RESEARCH<|>Nikhil Swamy is associated with Microsoft Research as a co-author of the library<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FSTAR.WELLFOUNDEDRELATION<|>MICROSOFT RESEARCH<|>The module is part of a library copyrighted by Microsoft Research<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>APACHE LICENSE, VERSION 2.0<|>MICROSOFT RESEARCH<|>The library by Microsoft Research is licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

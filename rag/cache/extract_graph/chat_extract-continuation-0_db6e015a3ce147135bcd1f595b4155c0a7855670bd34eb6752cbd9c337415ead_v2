Although the typing\nderivation may be useful in some cases, often returning the whole\nderivation is unnecessary. By marking the definition of the ``typing``\ninductive as shown below (and keeping the rest of the definition the\nsame), F* guarantees that the compiler will extract ``typing g e t``\nto the ``unit`` type and correspondinly, all values of ``typing g e\nt`` will be erased to the unit value ``()``\n\n.. code-block:: fstar\n\n   [@@erasable]\n   noeq\n   type typing : env -> exp -> typ -> Type = ... \n\nMarking a type with the ``erasable`` attribute and having it be erased\nto ``unit`` is safe because F* restricts how ``erasable`` types can be\nused. In particular, no ``Tot`` computations should be able to extract\ninformation from a value of an erasable type.\n\nClosely related to erasable types are a class of types that are called\n*non-informative*, defined inductively as follows:\n\n  1. The type ``Type`` is non-informative\n\n  2. The type ``prop`` is non-informative (i.e., unit and all its\n     subtypes)\n     \n  3. An erasable type is non-informative\n     \n  4. A function type ``x:t -> Tot s`` is non-informative, if ``s`` is\n     non-informative\n     \n  5. A ghost function type ``x:t -> GTot s`` is non-informative\n     \n  6. A function type ``x:t -> C``, with user-defined computation type\n     ``C``, is non-informative if the effect label of ``C`` has the\n     erasable attribute.\n\nIntuitively, a non-informative type is a type that cannot be\ncase-analyzed in a ``Tot`` context.\n\nWith this notion of non-informative types, we can now define the\nrestrictions on an ``erasable`` type:\n\n   1. Any computation that pattern matches on an erasable type must\n      return a non-informative type.\n\n   2. Inductive types with the ``erasable`` attribute do not support\n      built-in decidable equality and must also be marked ``noeq``.\n\n\nThe `erased` type, `reveal`, and `hide`\n---------------------------------------\n\nThe ``erasable`` attribute can only be added to new inductive type\ndefinitions and every instance of that type becomes erasable. If you\nhave a type like ``nat``, which is not erasable, but some occurrences\nof it (e.g., in the arguments to ``Vector.append``) need to be erased,\nthe F* standard library ``FStar.Ghost.fsti`` offers the following:\n\n.. code-block:: fstar\n                \n   (** [erased t] is the computationally irrelevant counterpart of [t] *)\n   [@@ erasable]\n   val erased (t:Type u#a) : Type u#a\n\n``FStar.Ghost`` also offers a pair of functions, ``reveal`` and\n``hide``, that form a bijection between ``a`` and ``erased a``.\n\n.. code-block:: fstar\n\n   val reveal (#a: Type u#a) (v:erased a) : GTot a\n\n   val hide (#a: Type u#a) (v:a) : Tot (erased a)\n\n   val hide_reveal (#a: Type) (x: erased a)\n     : Lemma (ensures (hide (reveal x) == x))\n             [SMTPat (reveal x)]\n             \n   val reveal_hide (#a: Type) (x: a)\n     : Lemma (ensures (reveal (hide x) == x))\n             [SMTPat (hide x)]                \n\nImportantly, ``reveal v`` breaks the abstraction of ``v:erased a``\nreturning just an ``a``, but doing so incurs a ``GTot`` effect---so,\n``reveal`` cannot be used in an arbitrary ``Tot`` contexts.\n\nDually, ``hide v`` can be used to erase ``v:a``, since a ``Tot``\ncontext cannot depend on the value of an ``erased a``.\n\nThe SMT patterns on the two lemmas allow F* and Z3 to automatically\ninstantiate the lemmas to relate a value and its hidden\ncounterpart---:ref:`this chapter <UTH_smt>` provides more details on\nhow SMT patterns work.\n\n**Implicit coercions**\n\n``FStar.Ghost.erased``, ``reveal``, and ``hide`` are so commonly used\nin F* that the compiler provides some special support for it. In\nparticular, when a term ``v:t`` is used in a context that expects an\n``erased t``, F* implictly coerces ``v`` to ``hide v``. Likewise, when\nthe context expects a ``t`` where ``v:erased t`` is provided, F*\nimplicitly coerces ``v`` to ``reveal v``.\n\nThe following examples illustrates a few usages and limitations. You\ncan ask F* to print the code with implicits enabled by using\n``--dump_module RevealHideCoercions --print_implicits``.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/RevealHideCoercions.fst\n   :language: fstar\n\nA few comments on these examples:\n      \n* The first two functions illustrate how\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

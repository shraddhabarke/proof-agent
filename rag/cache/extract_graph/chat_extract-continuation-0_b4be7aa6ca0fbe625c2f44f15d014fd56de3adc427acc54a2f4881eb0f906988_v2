Admitting a non-positive definition like dyn has allowed us to build a non-terminating loop.\n\nSuch loops can also allow one to prove False (breaking soundness),\nas the next example shows.\n\n#push-options \"--__no_positivity\"\nnoeq\ntype non_positive =\n  | NP : (non_positive -> False) -> non_positive\n#pop-options\n\nlet almost_false (f:non_positive)\n  : False\n  = let NP g = f in g f\n\nlet ff\n  : False\n  = almost_false (NP almost_false)\n\n\nThis example is very similar to dyn , except NP stores a\nnon-positive function that returns False , which allows use to\nprove ff : False , i.e., in this example, not only does the\nviolation of strict positivity lead to an infinite loop at runtime, it\nalso renders the entire proof system of F* useless, since one can\nprove False .\n\nFinally, in the example below, although the type also_non_pos does\nnot syntactically appear to the left of an arrow in a field of the ANP constructor, an instantiation of the type parameter f (e.g., with the type f_false ) does make it appear to the left of\nan arrow—so this type too is deemed not strictly positive, and can be used\nto prove False .\n\n#push-options \"--__no_positivity\"\nnoeq\ntype also_non_pos (f:Type -> Type) =\n  | ANP : f (also_non_pos f) -> also_non_pos f\n#pop-options\n\nlet f_false\n  : Type -> Type\n  = fun a -> (a -> False)\n\nlet almost_false_again\n  : f_false (also_non_pos f_false)\n  = fun x -> let ANP h = x in h x\n\nlet ff_again\n  : False\n  = almost_false_again (ANP almost_false_again)\n\n\nWe hope you are convinced that non-strictly positive types should not\nbe admissible in inductive type definitions. In what follows, we will\nno longer use the __no_positivity option. In a later section, once\nwe’ve introduced the effect of divergence , we will see that\nnon-positive definitions can safely be used in a context where\nprograms are not expected to terminate, allowing one to safely model\nthings like the dyn type, without compromising the soundness of\nF*.\n\nSometimes it is useful to parameterize an inductive definition with a\ntype function, without introducing a non-positive definition as we did\nin also_non_pos above.\n\nFor example, the definition below introduces a type free f a , a\nform of a tree whose leaf nodes contain a values, and whose\ninternal nodes branch according the type function f .\n\nnoeq\ntype free (f:([@@@ strictly_positive] _:Type -> Type))\n          (a:Type) \n  : Type =\n  | Leaf : a -> free f a\n  | Branch : f (free f a) -> free f a\n\n\nWe can instantiate this generic free to produce various kinds of\ntrees. Note: when instantiating free list a in variable_branching_list below, we need to explicitly re-define the list type with a strict-positivity annotation: F* does not\ncorrectly support rechecking type constructors to prove that they are\nstrictly positive when they are used at higher order.\n\nlet binary_tree (a:Type) = free (fun t -> t & t) a\nlet list_redef ([@@@strictly_positive] a:Type) = list a\nlet variable_branching_list a = free list_redef a\nlet infinite_branching_tree a = free (fun t -> nat -> t) a\n\n\nHowever, we should only be allowed to instantate f with type\nfunctions that are strictly positive in their argument, since otherwise\nwe can build a proof of False , as we did with also_non_pos . The @@@strictly_positive attribute on the\nformal parameter of f enforces this.\n\nIf we were to try to instantiate free with a non-strictly positive\ntype function,\n\nlet free_bad = free (fun t -> (t -> False)) int\n\n\nthen F* raises an error:\n\nBinder (t: Type) is marked strictly positive, but its use in the definition is not\n\n\nSometimes one indexes a type by another type, though the index has no\nsemantic meaning. For example, in several F* developments that model\nmutable state, the a heap reference is just a natural number modeling\nits address in the heap. However, one might use the type let ref (a:Type) = nat to represent the type of a reference, even though the\ntype a is not used in the definition. In such cases, it can be\nuseful to mark the parameter as unused, to inform F*’s positivity\nchecker that the type index is actually irrelevant. The snippet below\nshows an example:\n\nirreducible\nlet ref ([@@@unused] a:Type) = nat\nnoeq\ntype linked_list (a:Type) =\n  | LL : ref (a & linked_list a) -> linked_list a\nnoeq\ntype neg_unused =\n  | NU : ref (neg_unused -> bool) -> neg_unused\n\n\nHere, we’ve marked the parameter of ref with the unused attribute. We’ve also marked ref as irreducible just to\nensure for this example that F* does not silently unfold the\ndefinition of ref .\n\nNow, knowing that the parameter of ref is unused, one can define\ntypes like linked_list a , where although linked_list a appears\nas an argument to the ref type, the positivity checker accepts it,\nsince the parameter is unused. This is similar to the use of a strictly_positive annotation on a\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>F*<|>ORGANIZATION<|>F* is a programming language and proof assistant designed for program verification)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FALSE<|>EVENT<|>In the context of F*, FALSE represents a logical contradiction or an unsoundness in the proof system)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NON_POSITIVE<|>EVENT<|>A type definition in F* that allows for the creation of non-terminating loops and can lead to proving FALSE, indicating a break in the system's soundness)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALSO_NON_POS<|>EVENT<|>A type in F* that, despite not syntactically appearing non-positive, can be instantiated in a way that leads to proving FALSE)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FREE<|>EVENT<|>A generic type in F* representing a form of a tree, which can only be instantiated with strictly positive type functions to avoid unsoundness)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NON_POSITIVE<|>FALSE<|>Non-positive type definitions in F* can lead to proving FALSE, breaking the soundness of the system<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALSO_NON_POS<|>FALSE<|>The also_non_pos type can be used to prove FALSE, showing a potential for unsoundness in F*<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FREE<|>FALSE<|>Instantiating the free type with non-strictly positive type functions could potentially lead to proving FALSE, which F* prevents<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

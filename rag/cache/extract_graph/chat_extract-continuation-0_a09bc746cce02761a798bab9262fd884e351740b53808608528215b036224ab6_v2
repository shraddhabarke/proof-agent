We’ll look into ghost functions in much more detail in a later chapter.\n\nThis allows  type inference to work better, as shown below.\n\nfn move_alt (p:point) (dx:int) (dy:int)\nrequires is_point p 'xy\nensures is_point p (fst 'xy + dx, snd 'xy + dy)\n{\n  unfold is_point;\n  let x = !p.x;\n  let y = !p.y;\n  p.x := x + dx;\n  p.y := y + dy;\n  fold_is_point p;\n}\n\n\nIn addition to fold and unfold , one also often uses the rewrite command when working with defined predicates. Its general\nform is:\n\nwith x1 ... xn. rewrite p as q;\nrest\n\n\nIts behavior is to find a substitution subst that instantiates the x1 ... xn as v1 ... vn , such that subst(p) is supported by c in the context, Pulse aims to prove that subst(p) == subst(q) and replaces c in the context by subst(q) and\nproceeds to check subst(rest) .\n\nTo illustrate this at work, consider the program below:\n\nfn create_and_move ()\nrequires emp\nensures emp\n{\n    let mut x = 0;\n    let mut y = 0;\n    let p = { x; y };\n    //pts_to x 0 ** pts_to y 0\n    with _v. rewrite pts_to x _v as pts_to p.x _v;\n    with _v. rewrite pts_to y _v as pts_to p.y _v;\n    //pts_to p.x 0 ** pts_to p.y 0\n    fold_is_point p;\n    move p 1 1;\n    assert (is_point p (1, 1));\n    unfold is_point;\n    //pts_to p.x (fst (1, 1)) ** pts_to p.y (snd (1, 1))\n    with _v. rewrite pts_to p.x _v as pts_to x _v;\n    with _v. rewrite pts_to p.y _v as pts_to y _v;\n    //pts_to x (fst (1, 1)) ** pts_to y (snd (1, 1))\n}\n\n\nWe allocate two references and put them in the structure p . Now,\nto call fold_is_point , we need pts_to p.x _ and pts_to p.y _ , but the context only contains pts_to x _ and pts_to y _ . The rewrite command transforms the context as needed.\n\nAt the end of the function, we need to prove that pts_to x _ and pts_to y _ as we exit the scope of y and x , so that they\ncan be reclaimed. Using rewrite in the other direction\naccomplishes this.\n\nThis is quite verbose. As with fold and unfold , fully\nautomated rewrite in the general case is hard, but many common\ncases are easy and we expect to add support for that to the Pulse\nchecker.\n\nIn the meantime, Pulse provides a shorthand to make some common\nrewrites easier.\n\nThe rewrite each command has the most general form:\n\nwith x1 ... xn. rewrite each e1 as e1', ..., en as en' in goal\n\n\nThis is equivalent to:\n\nwith x1 ... xn. assert goal;\nrewrite each e1 as e1', ..., en as en' in goal\n\n\nrewrite each e1 as e1', ..., en as en' in goal\n\n\nis equivalent to\n\nrewrite goal as goal'\n\n\nwhere goal' is computed by rewriting, in parallel, every\noccurrence of ei as ei' in goal .\n\nFinally, one can also write:\n\nrewrite each e1 as e1', ..., en as en'\n\n\nomitting the goal term. In this case, the goal is taken to be\nthe entire current vprop context.\n\nUsing rewrite each ... makes the code somewhat shorter:\n\nfn create_and_move_alt ()\nrequires emp\nensures emp\n{\n    let mut x = 0;\n    let mut y = 0;\n    let p = { x; y };\n    rewrite each x as p.x, y as p.y;\n    fold_is_point p;\n    move p 1 1;\n    assert (is_point p (1, 1));\n    unfold is_point;\n    rewrite each p.x as x, p.y as y;\n}\n\n\n© Copyright 2020, Microsoft Research.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>POINT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A conceptual entity used in programming to represent a point in space, typically having x and y coordinates)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FOLD_IS_POINT<|>EVENT<|>A function or process in programming that encapsulates the state of a point into a more abstract representation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MOVE_ALT<|>EVENT<|>A function that changes the position of a point by adjusting its x and y coordinates)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CREATE_AND_MOVE<|>EVENT<|>A function that initializes a point with zero coordinates and then moves it to a new position)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CREATE_AND_MOVE_ALT<|>EVENT<|>An alternative function that initializes a point with zero coordinates and then moves it to a new position, using a shorthand for rewriting)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FOLD_IS_POINT<|>POINT<|>The fold_is_point function operates on a point entity to change its state<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MOVE_ALT<|>POINT<|>The move_alt function changes the coordinates of a point entity<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CREATE_AND_MOVE<|>POINT<|>The create_and_move function creates a point entity and changes its position<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CREATE_AND_MOVE_ALT<|>POINT<|>The create_and_move_alt function creates a point entity and changes its position using a shorthand method<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

However, sometimes,\nthe SMT solver is really not able to complete our proof, or takes too\nlong to do so, or is not robust (i.e. works or fails due to seemingly\ninsignificant changes).\n\nThis is what Meta-F* was originally designed for. It provides the\nprogrammer with more control on how to break down a proof and guide\nthe SMT solver towards finding a proof by using tactics . Moreover, a\nproof can be fully completed within Meta-F* without using the SMT\nsolver at all. This is the usual approach taken in other proof\nassistants (such as Lean, Coq, or Agda), but it’s not the preferred\nroute in F*: we will use the SMT for the things it can do well, and\nmostly write tactics to “preprocess” obligations and make them easier\nfor the solver, thus reducing manual effort.\n\nMeta-F* also allows for metaprogramming , i.e. generating programs\n(or types, or proofs, …) automatically. This should not be\nsurprising to anyone already familiar with proof assistants and the Curry-Howard correspondence . There\nare however some slight differences between tactic-based proofs and\nmetaprogramming, and more so in F*, so we will first look at\nautomating proofs (i.e. tactics), and then turn to metaprogramming\n(though we use the generic name “metaprogram” for tactics as well).\n\nIn summary, when the SMT solver “just works” we usually do not bother\nwriting tactics, but, if not, we still have the ability to roll up our\nsleeves and write explicit proofs.\n\nSpeaking of rolling up our sleeves, let us do just that, and get our\nfirst taste of tactics.\n\nContents:\n\n- An Overview of Tactics\n\n© Copyright 2020, Microsoft Research.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_9af066a51888589bc97c245544233114390aa85576ccd931ad278f9ecba26e50_v2"}

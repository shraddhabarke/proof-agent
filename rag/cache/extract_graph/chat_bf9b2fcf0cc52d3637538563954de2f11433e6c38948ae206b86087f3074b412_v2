Notice that ``mem`` uses an ``eqtype``, :ref:`the type of\ntypes that support decidable equality <Part1_equality>`.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Part1.Quicksort.fst\n       :language: fstar\n       :start-after: SNIPPET_START: sorted mem\n       :end-before: SNIPPET_END: sorted mem\n\nGiven a sorting algorithm ``sort``, we would like to prove the\nfollowing property, meaning that for all input list ``l``, the\nresulting list ``sort l`` is sorted and has all the elements that\n``l`` does.\n\n.. code-block:: fstar\n\n    forall l. sorted (sort l) /\\ (forall i. mem i l <==> mem i (sort l))\n\nThis specification is intentionally a bit weak, e.g., in case there\nare multiple identical elements in ``l``, this specification does not\nprevent ``sort`` from retaining only one of them.\n\nWe will see how to improve this specification below, as part of an\nexercise.\n\nIf you're unfamiliar with the algorithm, you can `read more about it\nhere <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort>`_. We'll describe\nseveral slightly different implementations and proofs of Quicksort in\ndetail—you may find it useful to follow along interactively with the\n`entire code development <../code/Part1.Quicksort.fst>`_ of this\nsequence.\n\nImplementing ``sort``\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nOur implementation of Quicksort is pretty simple-minded. It always\npicks the first element of the list as the pivot; partitions the rest\nof the list into those elements greater than or equal to the pivot,\nand the rest; recursively sorts the partitions; and slots the pivot in\nthe middle before returning. Here it is:\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Part1.Quicksort.fst\n       :language: fstar\n       :start-after: SNIPPET_START: sort-impl\n       :end-before: SNIPPET_END: sort-impl\n\nThere are a few points worth discussing in detail:\n\n1. The notation ``((<=) pivot)`` may require some explanation: it is\n   the *partial application* of the ``<=`` operator to just one\n   argument, ``pivot``. It is equivalent to ``fun x -> pivot <= x``.\n\n2. We have to prove that ``sort`` terminates. The measure we've\n   provided is ``length l``, meaning that at each recursive call,\n   we're claiming that the length of input list is strictly\n   decreasing.\n\n3. Why is this true? Well, informally, the recursive calls ``sort lo``\n   and ``sort hi`` are partitions of the ``tl`` of the list, which is\n   strictly shorter than ``l``, since we've removed the ``pivot``\n   element. We'll have to convince F* of this fact by giving\n   ``partition`` an interesting type that we'll see below.\n\nImplementing ``partition``\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nHere's an implementation of ``partition``. It's a :ref:`higher-order\nfunction <Part1_higher_order_functions>`, where ``partition f l``\nreturns a pair of lists ``l₁`` and ``l₂``, a partitioning of the\nelements in ``l`` such that the every element in ``l₁`` satisfies\n``f`` and the elements in ``l₂`` do not.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Part1.Quicksort.fst\n       :language: fstar\n       :start-after: SNIPPET_START: partition\n       :end-before: SNIPPET_END: partition\n\nThe specification we've given ``partition`` is only partial—we do not\nsay, for instance, that all the elements in ``l₁`` satisfy ``f``. We\nonly say that the sum of the lengths of the ``l₁`` and ``l₂`` are\nequal to the length of ``l``. That's because that's the only property\nwe need (so far) about ``partition``—this property about the lengths\nis what we need to prove that on the recursive calls ``sort lo`` and\n``sort hi``, the arguments ``lo`` and ``hi`` are strictly shorter than\nthe input list.\n\nThis style of partial specification should give you a sense of the art\nof program proof and the design choices between :ref:`intrinsic and\nextrinsic proof <Part1_intrinsic_extrinsic>`. One tends to specify\nonly what one needs, rather than specifying all properties one can\nimagine right up front.\n\nProving ``sort`` correct\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nNow that we have our definition of ``sort``, we still have to prove it\ncorrect. Here's a proof—it requires three auxiliary lemmas and we'll\ndiscuss it in detail.\n\nOur first lemma relates ``partition`` to ``mem``: it proves what we\nleft out in the intrinsic specification of ``partition``, i.e., that\nall the elements in ``l₁`` satisfy ``f``, the elements in ``l₂`` do\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_bf9b2fcf0cc52d3637538563954de2f11433e6c38948ae206b86087f3074b412_v2"}

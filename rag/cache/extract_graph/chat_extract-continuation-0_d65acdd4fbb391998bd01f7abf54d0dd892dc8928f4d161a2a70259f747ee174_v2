Its syntax, type system, and runtime behavior can be\ndescribed in just a few lines. The main result we're interested in\nproving is the soundness of the type system, i.e., that if a program\ntype checks then it can be executed safely without a certain class of\nruntime errors.\n\nIf you haven't seen the STLC before, there are several good resources\nfor it available on the web, including the `Software Foundations book\n<https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/plf-current/Stlc.html>`_,\nthough we'll try to keep the presentation here as self-contained as\npossible. Thanks to Simon Forest, Catalin Hritcu, and Simon Schaffer\nfor contributing parts of this case study.\n\nSyntax\n++++++\n\nThe syntax of programs :math:`e` is defined by the context-free\ngrammar shown below.\n\n.. math::\n\n   e~::=~()~|~x~|~\\lambda x:t. e_0~|~e_0~e_1\n\nThis can be read as follows: a program :math:`e` is either\n\n  * the unit value :math:`()`;\n\n  * a variable :math:`x`;\n\n  * a lambda term :math:`\\lambda x:t. e_0` associating a variable\n    :math:`x` to a type :math:`t` and a some sub-program :math:`e_0`;\n\n  * or, the application of the sub-program :math:`e_0` to another\n    sub-program :math:`e_1`.\n\nThe syntax of the type annotation :math:`t` is also very simple:\n\n.. math::\n\n   t~::=~\\mathsf{unit}~|~t_0 \\rightarrow t_1\n\nA type :math:`t` is either\n\n  * the :math:`\\mathsf{unit}` type constant;\n\n  * or, arrow type :math:`t_0 \\rightarrow t_1` formed from two smaller types\n    :math:`t_0` and :math:`t_1`\n\nThis language is very minimalistic, but it can be easily extended with\nsome other forms, e.g., one could add a type of integers, integer\nconstants, and operators like addition and subtraction. We'll look at\nthat as part of some exercises.\n\nWe'll define the syntax of types and programs formally in F* as a pair\nof simple inductive datatypes ``typ`` (for types) and ``exp`` (for\nprograms or expressions) with a constructor for each of the cases\nabove.\n\nThe main subtlety is in the representation of variables.  For example,\nignoring the type annotations, in the term\n:math:`\\lambda x. (\\lambda x. x)` the inner lambda binds *a different*\n:math:`x` than the outer one, i.e., the term is equivalent to\n:math:`\\lambda x. (\\lambda y. y)` and our representation of programs\nmust respect this this convention. We'll use a technique called de\nBruijn indices, where the names of the variables are no longer\nsignificant and instead each variable is represented by a natural\nnumber describing the number of :math:`\\lambda` binders that one must\ncross when traversing a term from the occurrence of the variable to\nthat variable's :math:`\\lambda` binder.\n\nFor example, the terms :math:`\\lambda x. (\\lambda x. x)` and\n:math:`\\lambda x. (\\lambda y. y)` are both represented as\n:math:`\\lambda _. (\\lambda _. 0)`, since the inner occurrence of\n:math:`x` is associated with the inner :math:`\\lambda`; while\n:math:`\\lambda x. (\\lambda y. (\\lambda z. x))` is represented as\n:math:`\\lambda _. (\\lambda _. (\\lambda _. 2)`, since from the inner\noccurrence of :math:`x` one must skip past :math:`2` :math:`\\lambda`'s\nto reach the :math:`\\lambda` associated with :math:`x`. Note, the\nvariable names are no longer significant in de Bruijn's notation.\n\nRepresenting types\n------------------\n\nThe inductive type ``typ`` defined below is our representation of\ntypes.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Part2.STLC.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: typ$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: typ$\n\nThis is entirely straightforward: a constructor for each case in our\ntype grammar, as described above.\n\nRepresenting programs\n---------------------\n\nThe representation of program expressions is shown below:\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Part2.STLC.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: exp$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: exp$\n\nThis too is straightforward: a constructor for each case in our\nprogram grammar, as described above. We use a ``nat`` to represent\nvariables ``var`` and ``ELam`` represents an annotated lambda term of\nthe form :math:`\\lambda _:t. e`, where the name of the binder is\nomitted, since we're\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SIMPLY TYPED LAMBDA CALCULUS<|>EVENT<|>A case study in a very simple programming language often studied in introductory courses on the semantics of programming languages.

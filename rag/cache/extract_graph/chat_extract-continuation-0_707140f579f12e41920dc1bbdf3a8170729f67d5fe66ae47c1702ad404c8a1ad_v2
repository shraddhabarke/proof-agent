Instead, it discusses programming constructs, functions, and tactics within a formal verification framework.\n\nHowever, interpreting the request to fit the context of the provided text, we can attempt to identify \"entities\" in a more abstract sense, related to the programming constructs and their relationships as defined within the code. This interpretation stretches the original instructions to fit a context they were not designed for, and as such, the output will be speculative and not in line with the expected types of entities (organization, person, geo, event).\n\nGiven the constraints and the nature of the text, no entities or relationships can be extracted that fit the specified types.

Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n \n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n \n3.

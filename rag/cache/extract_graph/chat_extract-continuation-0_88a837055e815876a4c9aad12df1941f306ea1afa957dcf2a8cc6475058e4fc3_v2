Once we gather up the\npermission on left and right , and now the contributions left right i v tells us that v == i + 1 + 1 , which is what we\nneed to conclude.\n\nOur next attempt aims to write a single function incr , rather than incr_left and incr_right , and to give incr a more\nabstract, modular specification. The style we use here is based on an\nidea proposed by Bart Jacobs and Frank Piessens in a paper titled Expressive modular fine-grained concurrency specification .\n\nThe main idea is to observe that incr_left and incr_right only\ndiffer by the ghost code that they execute. But, Pulse is higher\norder: so, why not parameterize a single function by incr and let\nthe caller instantiate incr twice, with different bits of ghost\ncode. Also, while we’re at it, why not also generalize the\nspecification of incr so that it works with any user-chosen\nabstract predicate, rather than contributions and left/right ghost state. Here’s how:\n\nfn incr (x: ref int)\n        (#p:perm)\n        (#refine #aspec: int -> vprop)\n        (l:L.lock)\n        (ghost_steps: \n          (v:int -> vq:int -> stt_ghost unit\n               emp_inames\n               (refine v ** aspec vq ** pts_to x (v + 1))\n               (fun _ -> refine (v + 1) ** aspec (vq + 1) ** pts_to x (v + 1))))\nrequires L.lock_alive l #p (exists* v. pts_to x v ** refine v) ** aspec 'i\nensures L.lock_alive l #p (exists* v. pts_to x v ** refine v) ** aspec ('i + 1)\n {\n    L.acquire l;\n    with _v. _;\n    let vx = !x;\n    rewrite each _v as vx;\n    x := vx + 1;\n    ghost_steps vx 'i;\n    L.release l;\n}\n\n\nAs before, incr requires x and the lock , but, this time,\nit is parameterized by:\n\n- A predicate refine , which generalizes the contributions predicate from before, and refines the value that x points to.\n\n- A predicate aspec , an abstract specification chosen by the\ncaller, and serves as the main specification for incr , which\ntransitions from aspec 'i to aspec ('i + 1) .\n\n- And, finally, the ghost function itself, ghost_steps , now\nspecified abstractly in terms of the relationship between refine , aspec and pts_to x —it says, effectively, that once x has been updated, the abstract predicates refine and aspec can be updated too.\n\nHaving generalized incr , we’ve now shifted the work to the\ncaller. But, incr , now verified once and for all, can be used with\nmany different callers just by instantiating it differently. For\nexample, if we wanted to do a three-way parallel increment, we could\nreuse our incr as is. Whereas, our first take would have to be\ncompletely revised, since incr_left and incr_right assume that\nthere are only two ghost references, not three.\n\nHere’s one way to instantiate incr , proving the same specification\nas add2 .\n\nfn add2_v2 (x: ref int)\nrequires pts_to x 'i\nensures pts_to x ('i + 2)\n{\n    let left = GR.alloc 0;\n    let right = GR.alloc 0;\n    GR.share left;\n    GR.share right;\n    fold (contributions left right 'i 'i);\n    let lock = L.new_lock (\n      exists* (v:int).\n        pts_to x v ** contributions left right 'i v\n    );\n    ghost\n    fn step\n        (lr:GR.ref int)\n        (b:bool { if b then lr == left else lr == right })\n        (v vq:int)\n      requires \n        contributions left right 'i v **\n        GR.pts_to lr #0.5R vq **\n        pts_to x (\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>GR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>GR refers to a ghost reference management system used for concurrent programming)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>L<|>ORGANIZATION<|>L refers to a lock management system for handling synchronization in concurrent programming)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INCR_LEFT<|>EVENT<|>A function or event where the left ghost reference's value is incremented)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INCR_RIGHT<|>EVENT<|>A function or event where the right ghost reference's value is incremented)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INCR<|>EVENT<|>A generalized function for incrementing a value, parameterized by ghost code and abstract predicates)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INCR_LEFT<|>GR<|>INCR_LEFT involves manipulating a left ghost reference managed by GR<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INCR_RIGHT<|>GR<|>INCR_RIGHT involves manipulating a right ghost reference managed by GR<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INCR<|>L<|>INCR requires a lock managed by L for synchronization<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INCR<|>GR<|>INCR is parameterized by ghost code that manipulates ghost references managed by GR<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

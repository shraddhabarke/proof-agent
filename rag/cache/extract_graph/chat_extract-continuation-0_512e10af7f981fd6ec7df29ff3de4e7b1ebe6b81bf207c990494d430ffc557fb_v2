[#] It is also possible to define ``post a = a -> prop`` and ``pre\n       = prop``. However, the F* libraries for pure WPs using\n       ``Type0`` instead of ``prop``, so we remain faithful to that\n       here.\n                \n.. [#] Dijkstra monads are also related to the continuation\n       monad. Continuation monad models `Continuation Passing Style\n       <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuation-passing_style/>`_\n       programming, where the control is passed to the callee\n       explicitly in the form of a continuation. For a result type\n       ``r``, the continuation monad is defined as follows:\n\n       .. literalinclude:: ../code/Pure.fst\n          :language: fstar\n          :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: cont$\n          :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: cont$                 \n\n       If we squint a bit, we can see that the ``wp`` monad we defined\n       earlier, is nothing but a continuation into ``Type0``, i.e.,\n       ``wp a = cont Type0 a`` (or ``cont prop a``, if one prefers to\n       use ``prop``).\n                \n``PURE`` and ``Tot``\n---------------------\n\nWhen typechecking a program, F* computes a weakest precondition which\ncharacterizes a necessary condition for the program to satisfy all its\ntyping constraints. This computed weakest precondition is usually\nhidden from the programmer, but if you annotate your program suitably,\nyou can get access to it, as shown in the code snippet below:\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Pure.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: square$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: square$\n\nThe type says that ``square n`` is a pure function, which for any\npostcondition ``q:nat -> prop``,\n\n  * Is defined only when ``n * n >= 0`` and when ``q (n * n)`` is valid\n    \n  * And returns a value ``m:nat`` satisfying ``q m``\n\nLet's look at another example:\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Pure.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: maybe_incr$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: maybe_incr$\n\nNotice how the ``wp`` index of ``PURE`` mirrors the structure of the\ncomputation itself---it starts with an ``if_then_else_wp``, then in\nthe first branch, uses a ``bind_wp`` followed by a return; and in the\nelse branch it returns ``x``.\n\nAs such, the wp-index simply \"lifts\" the computation into a\nspecification in a form amenable to logical reasoning, e.g., using the\nSMT solver. For pure programs this may seem like overkill, since the\npure term itself can be reasoned about directly, but when the term\ncontains non-trivial typing constraints, e.g., such as those that\narise from refinement type checking, lifting the entire program into a\nsingle constraint structures and simplifies logical reasoning.\n\nOf course, one often writes specifications that are more abstract than\nthe full logical lifting of the program, as in the example below,\nwhich says that to prove ``post`` of the return value, the\nprecondition is to prove ``post`` on all ``y >= x``. This is a\nvalid, although weaker, characterization of the function's return\nvalue.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Pure.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: maybe_incr2$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: maybe_incr2$\n\nThe ``PURE`` computation type comes with a built-in weakening rule. In\nparticular, if a term is computed to have type ``PURE a wp_a`` and it is\nannotated to have type ``PURE b wp_b``, then F* does the following:\n\n  1. It computes a constraint ``p : a -> Type0``, which is sufficient\n     to prove that ``a`` is a subtype of ``b``, e.g., is ``a = int``\n     and ``b = nat``, the constraint ``p`` is ``fun (x:int) -> x >=\n     0``.\n\n  2. Next, it strengthens ``wp_a`` to assert that the returned value\n     validates the subtyping constraints ``p x``, i.e., it builds\n     ``assert_wp wp_a p``, where\n\n     .. literalinclude:: ../code/Pure.fst\n        :language: fstar\n        :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: assert_wp$\n        :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: assert_wp$\n\n  3. Finally, it produces the verification condition ``stronger_wp #b\n     wp_b (assert_wp wp_a p)``, where ``stronger_wp`` is defined as\n     shown below:\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PURE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A computation type in F* that characterizes necessary conditions for programs to satisfy typing constraints)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A monad in F* for weakest preconditions, used for logical reasoning and verification in programming)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CONTINUATION MONAD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A monad model for Continuation Passing Style programming, related to the WP monad in its function)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>F*<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A programming language designed for program verification, utilizing monads like WP and PURE for typechecking and logical reasoning)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WP<|>PURE<|>WP is a monad used within the PURE computation type for specifying weakest preconditions<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CONTINUATION MONAD<|>WP<|>The WP monad is conceptually related to the Continuation Monad, sharing similar purposes in programming logic<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>F*<|>PURE<|>F* uses the PURE computation type for typechecking and verifying program correctness<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>F*<|>WP<|>F* utilizes the WP monad for logical reasoning and program verification<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>F*<|>CONTINUATION MONAD<|>F* discusses the Continuation Monad as related to its own WP monad for programming verification<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

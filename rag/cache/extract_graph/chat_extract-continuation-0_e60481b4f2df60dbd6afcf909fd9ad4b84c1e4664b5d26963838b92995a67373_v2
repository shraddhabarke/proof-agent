This is simlar to condition coverage but for expressions that do not occur as a condition. For example, expression coverage will break down and generate coverage for the following expression:\n\nvoid F(bool A, bool B)\n{\n    // Generate coverage for Boolean sub-expressions A and B\n    bool C = A && B;\n}\n\nExpressions are broken down and measured in the same manner as for Condition Coverage .\n\nCoverage for each Boolean sub-expression is (T + F) / 2 . T is 1 if the Boolean sub-expression evalutes to true and the associated non-masking condition evalutes to true. F is 1 if the Boolean sub-expression evalutes to false and the associated non-masking condition evalutes to true.\n\nIn some cases the value of the top-level expression is also tracked for expression coverage. In these cases, expression coverage is (T + F + ->T + ->F) / 4 .\n\n\nRTL Coverage\n\nThe compiler imposes a maximum identifier length on the generated RTL to meet EDA tool requirements. If users have problems with truncated variable names making exclusions difficult, they can increase the maximum identifier length by adding compile flag “–identifier-length=[target length]”\n\n\nRTL Map\n\nWhen --backend=sv is specified during compilation, the compiler produces a file named: *RtlMap.json . This file contains names of modules, register, and nets in the generated SystemVerilog. This can be useful for programmatically generating exclusion for RTL coverage tools that do not support wildcards in exclusion expressions.\n\n\nRTL Map Contents\n\nThe root of the RTL map is a JSON object. It contains the following members, each of which is a JSON array.\n\n\nbasic_blocks\n\nThe basic_blocks array contains 1 object per basic block (pipeline) in the generated RTL. Each basic block contains the identifiers for the corresponding module and instance. Basic blocks also contain the following members, each of which is a JSON array.\n\n\nnets\n\nThe nets array contains one entry for each register or wire declared in the basic block. Each entry comprises an identifier name, a width (in bits), and the index of the pipeline stage that writes to the net.\n\n\ndebug_signals\n\nThe per-basic-block debug_signals array contains one entry for each debug signal declared in the basic block. A debug signal should always be 0. A value of 1 indicates a bug during the Sandpiper compilation process.\n\n\nconstant_signals\n\nThe per-basic-block constant_signals array contains one entry for each bit in the basic block that is known to be constant. The generated RTL has assertions to verify that these bits are indeed constant.\n\n\nunused_signals\n\nThe per-basic-block unused_signals array contains one entry for each bit in the basic block that does not output from generated top-level module. The generated RTL has code to set these bits to x (unknown) during simulation.\n\n\nGlobal debug_signals\n\nThe global debug_signals array contains one entry for each debug signal declared in the top-level module. A debug signal should always be 0. A value of 1 indicates a bug during the Sandpiper compilation process.\n\n\nGlobal constant_signals\n\nThe global constant_signals array contains one entry for each bit that is part of a signal declared in the top-level generated module and is known to be constant. The generated RTL has assertions to verify that these bits are indeed constant.\n\n\nglobal_variables\n\nThe global_variables array contains 1 object per global variable instance in the generated RTL. Each global variable contains the identifiers for the corresponding module and instance. global variables also contain the following members, each of which is a JSON array.\n\n\nnets\n\nThe nets array contains one entry for each register or wire declared in the global variable. Each entry comprises and identifier name and a width (in bits).\n\n\ntop_level_signals\n\nThe per-global-variable top_level_signals array contains one entry for each signal declared in top-level and connected to this global variable. Each entry comprises and identifier name and a width(in bits).\n\n\nfifos\n\nThe fifos array contains 1 object per FIFO instance in the generated RTL. Each FIFO contains the identifiers for the corresponding module and instance.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>NON-MASKING CONDITION<|>EVENT<|>A specific condition in software testing where a sub-expression's evaluation to true or false directly influences the outcome of the top-level condition)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MODIFIED CONDITION/DECISION COVERAGE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A software testing method that involves evaluating every possible outcome of each condition and decision in the software code)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OPEN SOURCE VHDL VERIFICATION METHODOLOGY/CODE COVERAGE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A methodology for verifying VHDL code coverage, including focused expression coverage)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JOHN JOSEPH CHILENSKI<|>PERSON<|>Co-author of a paper on the applicability of modified condition/decision coverage to software testing)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STEVEN P.

Finally, we have a bit of regular F* referencing the five defined in Pulse. This is a really simple program, but it already\nillustrates how Pulse and F* interact in both directions.\n\nIn what follows, unless we really want to emphasize that a fragment of\ncode is Pulse embedded in a larger F* context, when showing Pulse\ncode, we’ll just show the Pulse part, omitting the “```pulse\n… ```” delimiters.\n\nSeparation Logic was invented by John Reynolds, Peter O’Hearn, and\nothers in the late 1990s as a way to reason about imperative programs\nthat use shared, mutable data structures, e.g., linked lists and\ngraphs—see this paper for an introduction to separation logic . In the subsequent\ndecades, several innovations were added to separation logic by many\npeople, generalizing it beyond just sequential heap-manipulating\nprograms to distributed programs, concurrent programs, asynchronous\nprograms, etc. that manipulate abstract resources of various kinds,\nincluding time and space, messages sent over communication channels,\netc.\n\nMuch like other Hoare Logics, which we reviewed in an earlier\nsection , separation logic comes in two parts.\n\nSeparation Logic Propositions First, we have a language of\npropositions that describe properties about program resources, e.g.,\nthe heap. These propositions have the type vprop in Pulse, [ 1 ] and, under the covers in the PulselCore semantics of Pulse, a vprop = state -> prop , where state represents the state of a program,\ne.g., the contents of memory. It is useful (at least at first) to think\nof a vprop as a memory property, though we will eventually treat\nit more abstractly and use it to model many other kinds of resources.\n\nSeparation Logic Hoare Triples To connect vprop ’s to programs,\nseparation logics use Hoare triples to describe the action of a\nprogram on its state. For example, the Hoare triple { p } c { n. q } describes a program c which when run in an initial state s0 satisfying p s0 (i.e., p is a precondition); c returns a value n while transforming the state to s1 satisfying q n s1 (i.e., q is a postcondition). Pulse’s\nprogram logic is a partial-correctness logic, meaning that c may\nalso loop forever, deadlock with other threads, etc.\n\nvprops (defined in Pulse.Lib.Pervasives ):\n\n- emp , the trivial proposition (equivalent to fun s -> True ).\n\n- pure p , heap-independent predicate fun s -> p . emp is\nequivalent to pure True .\n\nThe type of the program five illustrates how these vprop ’s are\nused in program specifications:\n\n- It is a function with a single unit argument—Pulse functions use\nthe keyword fn .\n\n- The precondition is just emp , the trivial assertion in\nseparation logic, i.e., five can be called in any initial\nstate.\n\n- The return value is an integer n:int\n\n- The postcondition may refer to the name of the return value ( n in this case) and here claims that the final state satisfies the pure proposition, n == 5 .\n\nIn other words, the type signature in Pulse is a convenient way to\nwrite the Hoare triple { emp } five () { n:int. pure (n == 5) } .\n\nOwnership At this point you may wonder if the postcondition of five is actually strong enough. We’ve only said that the return\nvalue n == 5 but have not said anything about the state that\nresults from calling five () . Perhaps this specification allows five to arbitrarily change any memory location in the state, since pure (5 == 5) is true of any state. [ 2 ] If you’re familiar with Low*,\nDafny, or other languages based on Hoare logic for heaps, you may be\nwondering about how come we haven’t specified a modifies -clause,\ndescribing exactly which part of the state a function may have\nchanged. The nice thing in separation logic is that there is no need\nto describe what parts of the state you may have modified. This is\nbecause a central idea in logic is the concept of ownership . To a\nfirst approximation, a computation can only access those resources\nthat it is explicitly granted access to in its precondition or those\nthat it creates itself. [ 3 ] In this case, with a precondition of emp , the function five does not have permission to access any resources, and so five simply cannot modify the state in any\nobservable way.\n\nSeparating Conjunction and the Frame Rule Let’s go back to incr and par_incr that we saw in the previous section and look\nat their types closely. We’ll need to introduce two more common vprop ’s, starting with the “points-to” predicate:\n\n- pts_to x v asserts that the reference x points to a cell\nin the current state that holds the value v .\n\nvprop ’s can also be combined in various ways, the most common one\nbeing the “separating conjunction”, written\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PULSE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Pulse is a programming model embedded within F* programs, designed to prove properties about concurrent separation logic)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>F*<|>ORGANIZATION<|>F* is a programming language that supports the embedding of Pulse, facilitating proofs in concurrent separation logic)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JOHN REYNOLDS<|>PERSON<|>One of the inventors of separation logic, a framework for reasoning about imperative programs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PETER O'HEARN<|>PERSON<|>One of the inventors of separation logic, contributing to its development for reasoning about shared, mutable data structures)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SEPARATION LOGIC<|>EVENT<|>A logical framework invented in the late 1990s for reasoning about imperative programs that manipulate shared, mutable data structures)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PULSE<|>F*<|>Pulse is a part of F* programs, showing interaction between the two in proving program properties<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JOHN REYNOLDS<|>SEPARATION LOGIC<|>John Reynolds contributed to the invention and development of separation logic<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PETER O'HEARN<|>SEPARATION LOGIC<|>Peter O'Hearn contributed to the invention and development of separation logic<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

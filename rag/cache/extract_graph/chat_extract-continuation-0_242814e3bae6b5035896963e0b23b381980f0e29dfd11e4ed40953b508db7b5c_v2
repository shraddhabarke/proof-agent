Meanwhile, you can learn more about type classes in F*\n   `from the wiki\n   <https://github.com/FStarLang/FStar/wiki/Typeclasses-(via-meta-arguments>`_\n   and from these `examples\n   <https://github.com/FStarLang/FStar/tree/master/examples/typeclasses>`_.\n\nFor example, if we were interested in just the read/write actions on a\nmutable integer state (as in our ``st a`` example), we could build an\ninstance of the ``action_class``, as shown below.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Part2.Free.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: rw_action_class$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: rw_action_class$\n\nHowever, we can define a type ``tree acts a``, the type of a computation\ntree whose effectful actions are from the class ``acts``, completely\ngenerically in the actions themselves.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Part2.Free.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: tree$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: tree$\n\nA ``tree act a`` has just two cases:\n\n  * Either it is a leaf node, ``Return x``, modeling a computation\n    that immediately returns the value ``x``;\n\n  * Or, we have a node ``DoThen act input k``, modeling a computation\n    that begins with some action ``act``, to which we pass some input,\n    and where ``k`` represents all the possible \"continuations\" of the\n    action, represented by a ``tree act a`` for each possible output\n    returned by the action. That is, ``DoThen`` represents a node in\n    the tree with a single action and a possibly infinite number of\n    sub-trees.\n\nWith this representation we can define ``return`` and ``bind``, and\nprove the monad laws once and for all.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Part2.Free.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: return and bind$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: return and bind$\n\n* The ``return`` combinator is easy, since we already have a\n  ``Return`` leaf node in the tree type.\n\n* The ``bind`` combinator is a little more interesting, involving a\n  structural recursion over the tree, relying (as we did in the\n  previous chapter on well-founded recursion) on the property that all\n  the trees returned by ``k`` are strictly smaller than the original\n  tree ``f``.\n\nTo prove the monad laws, we first need to define an equivalence\nrelation on trees---this relation is not quite just ``==``, since each\ncontinuation in the tree is function which itself returns a tree. So,\nwe define ``equiv`` blow, relating trees that are both ``Returns``, or\nwhen they both begin with the same action and have\npointwise-equivalent continuations.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Part2.Free.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: equiv$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: equiv$\n\n.. note::\n\n   We are specifically avoiding the use of :ref:`functional\n   extensionality <Part2_funext>` here, a property which allows\n   equating pointwise equal :math:`\\eta`-expanded functions. We show\n   how one can use functional extensionality in this development as an\n   advanced exercise.\n\nTo prove that ``equiv`` is an equivalence relation, here are lemmas\nthat prove that it is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive---we see\nhere a use of the syntactic sugar for logical connectives,\n:ref:`introduced in a previous chapter <Part2_connectives>`.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Part2.Free.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: equiv is an equivalence$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: equiv is an equivalence$\n\nNow, we can prove that ``tree`` satisifies the monad laws with respect\nto ``equiv``.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Part2.Free.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: tree is a monad$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: tree is a monad$\n\nThe associativity law, in particular, should make intuitive sense in\nthat a ``tree acts a`` represents a computation in a canonical fully\nleft-associative form, i.e., a single action followed by its\ncontinuation. As such, no matter how you associate computations in\n``bind``, the underlying representation is always fully\nleft-associated.\n\nHaving defined our computation trees generically, we can use them with\nany actions we like. For example, here's our ``read_and_increment``\nre-built using computation trees.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Part2.Free.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: read_and_increment$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: read_and_increment$\n\nFinally, given a computation tree we can \"run\" it, by interpreting it\nas a state-passing function.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Part2.Free.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: interp$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: interp$\n\n.. note::\n\n   A main difference between what we've shown here with ``interp`` and\n   a\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>FSTAR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>F* is a programming language designed for program verification, offering tools and examples for utilizing type classes and computation trees in programming and verification tasks)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ACTION_CLASS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A construct in F* programming representing a set of actions, specifically used in the context of mutable integer state manipulation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TREE ACTS A<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A type in F* representing a computation tree whose actions are defined by the class `acts`, allowing for generic definition of computation trees)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ACTION_CLASS<|>FSTAR<|>The action_class is a concept or construct utilized within F* programming for managing mutable states<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TREE ACTS A<|>FSTAR<|>Tree acts a is a type defined in F* to represent computation trees in a generic way, showcasing the language's capability for abstracting computation patterns<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

That's because equality on\n   lists of arbitrary types is not decidable, e.g., consider ``list\n   (int -> int)``.  All the proofs below will rely on propositional\n   equality.\n\nHowever, F* refuses to accept this as a valid type for ``reverse``:\nproving this property requires two separate inductions, neither of\nwhich F* can perform automatically.\n\nInstead, one can use two lemmas to prove the property we care\nabout. Here it is:\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Part1.Lemmas.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: SNIPPET_START: reverse_involutive\n   :end-before: SNIPPET_END: reverse_involutive\n\nIn the ``hd :: tl`` case of ``rev_involutive`` we are explicitly\napplying not just the induction hypothesis but also the ``snoc_cons``\nauxiliary lemma also proven there.\n\nExercises: Reverse is injective\n...............................\n\n`Click here <../code/exercises/Part1.Lemmas.fst>`_ for the exercise file.\n\nProve that reverse is injective, i.e., prove the following lemma.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Part1.Lemmas.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: SNIPPET_START: sig rev_injective\n   :end-before: SNIPPET_END: sig rev_injective\n\n.. container:: toggle\n\n    .. container:: header\n\n       **Answer**\n\n    .. literalinclude:: ../code/Part1.Lemmas.fst\n       :language: fstar\n       :start-after: SNIPPET_START: def rev_injective\n       :end-before: SNIPPET_END: def rev_injective\n\n    That's quite a tedious proof, isn't it.

We've already proven that\n    ``reverse`` is involutive, i.e., it is its own inverse. So, we\n    invoke our lemma, once for ``l1`` and once for ``l2``.  This gives\n    to the SMT solver the information that ``reverse (reverse l1) =\n    l1`` and ``reverse (reverse l2) = l2``, which suffices to complete\n    the proof. As usual, when structuring proofs, lemmas are your\n    friends!\n\nExercise: Optimizing reverse\n............................\n\nEarlier, we saw how to implement :ref:`a tail-recursive variant\n<Part1_termination_reverse>` of ``reverse``.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Part1.Termination.fst\n       :language: fstar\n       :start-after: SNIPPET_START: rev\n       :end-before: SNIPPET_END: rev\n\nProve the following lemma to show that it is equivalent to the\nprevious non-tail-recursive implementation, i.e.,\n\n.. code-block:: fstar\n\n   val rev_is_ok (#a:_) (l:list a) : Lemma (rev [] l == reverse l)\n\n.. container:: toggle\n\n    .. container:: header\n\n       **Answer**\n\n    .. literalinclude:: ../code/Part1.Lemmas.fst\n       :language: fstar\n       :start-after: SNIPPET_START: rev_is_ok\n       :end-before: SNIPPET_END: rev_is_ok\n\nExercise: Optimizing Fibonacci\n..............................\n\n\nEarlier, we saw how to implement :ref:`a tail-recursive variant\n<Part1_termination_fibonacci>` of ``fibonacci``---we show it again below.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Part1.Lemmas.fst\n       :language: fstar\n       :start-after: SNIPPET_START: fib_tail$\n       :end-before: SNIPPET_END: fib_tail$\n\nProve the following lemma to show that it is equivalent to the\nnon-tail-recursive implementation, i.e.,\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Part1.Lemmas.fst\n       :language: fstar\n       :start-after: SNIPPET_START: val fib_tail_is_ok$\n       :end-before: SNIPPET_END: val fib_tail_is_ok$                     \n\n.. container:: toggle\n\n    .. container:: header\n\n       **Answer**\n\n    .. literalinclude:: ../code/Part1.Lemmas.fst\n       :language: fstar\n       :start-after: SNIPPET_START: fib_is_ok$\n       :end-before: SNIPPET_END: fib_is_ok$\n\n.. _Part1_higher_order_functions:\n\nHigher-order functions\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nFunctions are first-class values—they can be passed to other functions\nand returned as results.

We’ll see\nmany more uses of F*’s normalizer as we go, but one basic usage of it\nis to use it to interpret programs.\n\nInvoking the interpreter is easy using fstar-mode.el in emacs. In emacs, go to the F* menu, then to Interactive queries , then choose Evaluate an expression (or type\nC-c C-s C-e): this prompts you to enter an expression that you want to\nevaluate: type sort ( <= ) [4;3;2;1] and then press “Enter”. You\nshould see the following output: sort ( <= ) [4;3;2;1] ↓ β δ ι ζ [1; 2; 3; 4] <: Prims.Tot (list int) , saying that the input term reduced to [1; 2; 3; 4] of type Tot (list int) .\n\nThe ↓ β δ ι ζ may seem a bit arcane, but\nit describes the reduction strategy that F* used to interpret the term:\n\n- β means that functions were applied\n\n- δ means that definitions were unfolded\n\n- ι means that patterns were matched\n\n- ζ means that recursive functions were unrolled\n\nWe’ll revisit what these reduction steps mean in a later chapter,\nincluding how to customize them for your needs.\n\nThe main way to execute F* programs is by compiling, or extracting ,\nthem to OCaml and then using OCaml’s build system and runtime to\nproduce an executable and run it.\n\nNote\n\nThe method that we show here works for simple projects with just a few\nfiles. For larger projects, F* offers a dependence analysis that can\nproduce dependences for use in a Makefile. F* also offers separate\ncompilation which allows a project to be checked one file at a time,\nand for the results to be cached and reused. For documentation and\nexamples of how to use these features and structure the build for\nlarger projects see these resources:\n\n- Dealing with dependences\n\n- Caching verified modules\n\n- A multifile project\n\nTo extract OCaml code from a F* program use the command-line options,\nas shown below:\n\nfstar --codegen OCaml --extract Part1.Quicksort --odir out Part1.Quicksort.Generic.fst\n\n\n- The --codegen option tells F* to produce OCaml code\n\n- The --extract option tells F* to only extract all modules in the given namespace, i.e., in this case, all modules in Part1.Quicksort\n\n- The --odir option tells F* to put all the generated files into the specified directory; in this case out\n\n- The last argument is the source file to be checked and extracted\n\nThe resulting OCaml code is in the file Part1_Quicksort_Generic.ml , where the F* dot -separated name is\ntransformed to OCaml’s naming convention for modules. The generated code is here\n\nSome points to note about the extracted code:\n\n- F* extracts only those definitions that correspond to executable\ncode. Lemmas and other proof-only aspects are erased. We’ll learn\nmore about erasure in a later chapter.\n\n- The F* types are translated to OCaml types. Since F* types are more\nprecise than OCaml types, this translation process necessarily\ninvolves a loss in precision. For example, the type of total orders\nin Part1.Quicksort.Generic.fst is: let total_order_t (a:Type) = f:(a -> a -> bool) { total_order f } Whereas in OCaml it becomes type 'a total_order_t = ' a -> 'a -> Prims.bool This means that you need to be careful when calling your extracted\nF* program from unverified OCaml code, since the OCaml compiler will\nnot complain if you pass in some function that is not a total order\nwhere the F* code expects a total order.\n\nlet total_order_t (a:Type) = f:(a -> a -> bool) { total_order f }\n\n\ntype 'a total_order_t = 'a -> 'a -> Prims.bool\n\n\nOur extracted code provides several top-level functions (e.g., sort ) but not main . So, we can only compile it as a library.\n\nFor simple uses, one can compile the generated code into a OCaml\nnative code library (a cmxa file) with ocamlbuild , as shown below\n\nOCAMLPATH=$FSTAR_HOME/lib ocamlbuild -use-ocamlfind -pkg batteries -pkg fstar.lib Part1_Quicksort_Generic.cmxa\n\n\nSome points to note:\n\n- You need to specify the variable OCAMLPATH which OCaml uses to\nfind required libraries. For F* projects, the OCAMLPATH should\ninclude the bin directory of the FStar release bundle.\n\n- The -use-ocamlfind option enables a utility to find OCaml libraries.\n\n- Extracted F* programs rely on two libraries: batteries and fstar.lib , which is what the -pkg options say.\n\n- Finally, Part1_Quicksort_Generic.cmxa references the name of\nthe corresponding .ml file, but with the .cmxa extension\nto indicate that we want to compile it as a\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_ab7770f4231a6e930f8544fe435b562e2d4f3cf464483d66287541eb942a7000_v2"}

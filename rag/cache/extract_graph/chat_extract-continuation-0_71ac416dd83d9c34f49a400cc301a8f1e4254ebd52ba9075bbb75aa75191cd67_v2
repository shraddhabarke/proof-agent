Given the constraints and the nature of the text provided, it appears to be a technical excerpt related to programming, specifically within the context of formal verification or computer algebra systems. The text does not explicitly mention entities that fit neatly into the predefined categories of organization, person, geo, or event. Instead, it discusses programming constructs, functions, and mathematical concepts, which do not align with the requested entity types.\n\nHowever, to adhere to the instructions and attempt to extract relevant entities, we must interpret the text more creatively.

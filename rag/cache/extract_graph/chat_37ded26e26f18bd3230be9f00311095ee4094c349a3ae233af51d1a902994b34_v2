F*'s\ntype inference includes such a feature, but is considerably more\npowerful. Like in other dependently typed language, F*'s inference\nengine is based on `higher-order unification\n<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unification_(computer_science)#Higher-order_unification>`_\nand can be used to infer arbitrary fragments of program text, not just\ntype annotations on variables.\n\nLet's consider our simple example of the definition and use of the\nidentity function again\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Part1.Poly.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: id\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: id\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Part1.Poly.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: id applications\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: id applications\n\nInstead of explicitly providing that first type argument when applying\n``id``, one could write it as follows, replacing the type arguments\nwith an underscore ``_``.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Part1.Poly.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: implicit id applications\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: implicit id applications\n\nThe underscore symbols is a wildcard, or a hole in program, and it's\nthe job of the F* typechecker to fill in the hole.\n\n.. note::\n\n   Program holes are a very powerful concept and form the basis of\n   Meta-F*, the metaprogramming and tactics framework embedded in\n   F*---we'll see more about holes in a later section.\n\nImplicit arguments\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nSince it's tedious to write an ``_`` everywhere, F* has a notion of\n*implicit arguments*. That is, when defining a function, one can add\nannotations to indicate that certain arguments can be omitted at call\nsites and left for the typechecker to infer automatically.\n\nFor example, one could write\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Part1.Poly2.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: id\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: id\n\ndecorating the first argument ``a`` with a ``#``, to indicate that it is\nan implicit argument. Then at call sites, one can simply write:\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Part1.Poly2.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: id applications\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: id applications\n\n\nAnd F* will figure out instantiations for the missing first argument\nto ``id``.\n\nIn some cases, it may be useful to actually provide an implicit\nargument explicitly, rather than relying on the F* to pick one. For\nexample, one could write the following:\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Part1.Poly2.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: explicit id applications\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: explicit id applications\n\nIn each case, we provide the first argument of ``id`` explicitly, by\npreceding it with a ``#`` sign, which instructs F* to take the user's\nterm rather than generating a hole and trying to fill it.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_37ded26e26f18bd3230be9f00311095ee4094c349a3ae233af51d1a902994b34_v2"}

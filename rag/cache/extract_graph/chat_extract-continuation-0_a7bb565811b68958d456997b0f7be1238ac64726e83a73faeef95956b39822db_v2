After all, it may be the case that some instances of\n``bounded_unsigned_int`` types support only addition while others\nsupport only subtraction. However, when designing typeclass\nhierarchies one needs to be careful to not introduce coherence\nproblems that result from various forms of multiple inheritance.\n\nHere's a typeclass that captures only the subtraction operation,\ninheriting from a base class.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/TypeclassesAlt2.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: subtractable$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: subtractable$\n\nAnd here's another typeclass that provides only the comparison\noperation, also inheriting from the base class.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/TypeclassesAlt2.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: comparable$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: comparable$\n\nHowever, now when writing programs that expect both subtractable and\ncomparable integers, we end up with a coherence problem.\n\nThe ``sub`` operation fails to verify, with F* complaining that it\ncannot prove ``fits op_Subtraction bound acc``, i.e., this ``sub`` may\nunderflow.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/TypeclassesAlt2.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: try_sub_fail$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: try_sub_fail$\n\nAt first, one may be surprised, since the ``s :\nsubtractable_bounded_unsigned_int a`` instance tells us that\nsubtracting from the ``bound`` is always safe.

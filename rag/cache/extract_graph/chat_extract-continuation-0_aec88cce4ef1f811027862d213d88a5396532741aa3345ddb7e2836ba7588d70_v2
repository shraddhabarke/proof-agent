You\ncan ask F* to print the code with implicits enabled by using\n``--dump_module RevealHideCoercions --print_implicits``.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/RevealHideCoercions.fst\n   :language: fstar\n\nA few comments on these examples:\n      \n* The first two functions illustrate how a ``nat`` is coerced\n  implicitly to ``erased nat``. Note, the effect of ``auto_reveal`` is\n  ``GTot``\n\n* ``auto_reveal_2`` fails, since the the annotation claims,\n  incorrectly, that the effect label is ``Tot``\n\n* ``incr`` is just a ``nat -> nat`` function.\n\n* ``incr_e`` is interesting because it calls ``incr`` with an\n  ``erased nat`` and the annotation expects an ``erased nat``\n  too. The body of ``incr_e`` is implicitly coerced to ``hide (incr\n  (reveal x))``\n\n* ``incr'`` is interesting, since it calls ``incr_e``: its body\n  is implicitly coerced to ``reveal (incr_e (hide x))``\n\n* Finally, ``poly`` shows the limitations of implicit coercion: F*\n  only inserts coercions when the expected type of the term in a\n  context and the type of the term differ by an ``erased``\n  constructor. In ``poly``, since ``==`` is polymorphic, the expected\n  type of the context is just an unresolved unification variable and,\n  so, no coercion is inserted. Instead, F* complains that ``y`` has\n  type ``erased nat`` when the type ``nat`` was expected.\n  \n\n.. _Ghost_in_total_contexts:\n\nUsing Ghost Computations in Total Contexts\n------------------------------------------\n\nWe have already noted that ``Tot < GTot``, enabling ``Tot``\ncomputations to be re-used in ``GTot`` contexts. For erasure to be\nsound, it is crucial that ``GTot`` terms cannot be used in ``Tot``\ncontexts, and indeed, F* forbids this in general. However, there are\ntwo exceptions.\n\n\nEffect Promotion for Non-informative Types\n..........................................\n\nConsider a term ``f`` with type ``GTot s``, where ``s`` is a\nnon-informative type. Since ``s`` is non-informative, no total context\ncan extract any information from ``f``. As such, F* allows implicitly\npromoting ``GTot s`` to ``Tot s``, when ``s`` is a non-informative\ntype.\n\nFor instance, the following is derivable,\n``hide (factorial 0) : Tot (erased nat)``: let's work through it in detail.\n\n1. We know that that ``factorial n : GTot nat``\n   \n2. Recall from the discussion on :ref:`evaluation order\n   <Part4_evaluation_order>` and the application of functions to\n   effectful arguments, ``hide (factorial 0)`` is equivalent to ``let\n   x = factorial 0 in hide x``, where ``x:nat`` and\n   ``hide x : Tot (erased nat)``.\n   \n3. From the rule for sequential composition of effectful terms, the\n   type of ``let x = factorial 0 in hide x`` should be ``GTot (erased\n   nat)``, since ``GTot = lub GTot Tot``.\n\n4. Since ``erased nat`` is a non-informative type, ``GTot (erased\n   nat)`` is promoted to ``Tot (erased nat)``, which is then the type\n   of ``hide (factorial 0)``.\n\n\nEffect promotion for ghost functions returning non-informative types\nis very useful. It allows one to mix ghost computations with total\ncomputations, so long as the result of the ghost sub-computation is\nhidden with an erased type. For instance, in the code below, we use\n``hide (factorial (n - 1))`` and use the result ``f_n_1`` in an\nassertion to or some other proof step, all within a function that is\nin the ``Tot`` effect.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/FactorialTailRec.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: factorial_tail_alt$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: factorial_tail_alt$\n\n\nFStar.Ghost.Pull.pull\n.....................\n\nConsider applying ``map factorial [0;1;2]``, where ``map : (a ->\nTot b) -> list a -> list b``. F* refuses to typecheck this written,\nsince ``factorial : nat -> GTot nat``, which is not a subtype of ``nat\n-> Tot nat``.\n\nUsing effect promotion, one could write ``map (fun x -> hide\n(factorial x)) [0;1;2]``, but this has type ``list (erased nat)``,\nwhich is not the same as ``list nat``.\n\nThis is unfortunate since it seems that basic libraries designed for\nuse with with higher-order total functions cannot be reused with ghost\nfunctions. [#]_\n\nThe library function ``FStar.Ghost.Pull.pull`` can help in such\nsituatinos. It has the following signature:\n\n.. code-block:: fstar\n\n   val pull (#a:Type) (#b:a -> Type) (f: (x:a -> GTot (b x)))\n     : GTot (x:a -> b x)\n\n   val pull_equiv (#a\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>F*<|>ORGANIZATION<|>F* is a programming language designed with an emphasis on formal verification, allowing for the specification and verification of properties of programs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NAT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Nat represents natural numbers in F*'s type system, used in various examples to illustrate implicit coercion and ghost computations)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ERASED NAT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Erased Nat is a type in F* that represents a natural number in a ghost context, where the value is not computationally relevant and can be erased during compilation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GTOT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>GTot is an effect in F* indicating a computation that may produce a result while performing ghost operations, which are not observable in the program's output)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TOT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Tot is an effect in F* indicating a total function, which is guaranteed to produce a result for any input without side effects)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FACTORIAL<|>PERSON<|>Factorial is a function example used in F* to illustrate the use of ghost computations and effect promotion in total contexts)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NAT<|>ERASED NAT<|>Nat is implicitly coerced to Erased Nat in certain contexts within F* to facilitate ghost computations<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GTOT<|>TOT<|>GTot computations can be used in Tot contexts under certain conditions, illustrating the relationship between ghost and total computations in F*<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FACTORIAL<|>GTOT<|>Factorial is an example of a function that operates under the GTot effect, demonstrating ghost computations<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FACTORIAL<|>TOT<|>Factorial's result can be promoted from GTot to Tot when it is of a non-informative type, showing the interaction between ghost computations and total contexts<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

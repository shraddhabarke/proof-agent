A type system in this style is sometimes\ncalled a Pure Type System or PTS .\n\nIn F* (as in other PTSs) types have types too, functions can take\ntypes as arguments and return types as results, etc. In particular,\nthe type of a type is Type , e.g., bool : Type , int : Type , int -> int : Type etc. In fact, even Type has a type—as\nwe’ll see when we learn about universes .\n\nMost modern typed languages provide a way to write programs with\ngeneric types. For instance, C# and Java provide generics, C++ has\ntemplates, and languages like OCaml and Haskell have several kinds of\npolymorphic types.\n\nIn F*, writing functions that are generic or polymorphic in types\narises naturally as a special case of the arrow types that we have already learned about. For example,\nhere’s a polymorphic identity function:\n\nlet id : a:Type -> a -> a = fun a x -> x\n\n\nThere are a several things to note here:\n\n- The type of id is an arrow type, with two arguments. The first\nargument is a : Type ; the second argument is a term of type a ; and the result also has the same type a .\n\n- The definition of id is a lambda term with two arguments a : Type (corresponding to the first argument type) and x : a . The\nfunction returns x —it’s an identity function on the second\nargument.\n\nJust as with any function, you can write it instead like this:\n\nlet id (a:Type) (x:a) : a = x\n\n\nTo call id , one can apply it first to a type and then to a value of that type, as shown below.\n\nlet _ : bool = id bool true\nlet _ : bool = id bool false\nlet _ : int = id int (-1)\nlet _ : nat = id nat 17\nlet _ : string = id string \"hello\"\nlet _ : int -> int = id (int -> int) (id int)\n\n\nWe’ve defined a function that can be applied to a value x:a for\nany type a . The last line there maybe requires a second read: we\ninstantiated id to int -> int and then applied it to id instantiated to int .\n\nLet’s try a few simple exercises. Click here for the exercise file.\n\nTry defining functions with the following signatures:\n\nval apply (a b:Type) (f:a -> b) : a -> b\nval compose (a b c:Type) (f: b -> c) (g : a -> b) : a -> c\n\n\nAnswer\n\nlet apply a b f = fun x -> f x\nlet compose a b c f g = fun x -> f (g x)\n\n\nHow about writing down a signature for twice :\n\nlet twice a f x = compose a a a f f x\n\n\nAnswer\n\nval twice (a:Type) (f: a -> a) (x:a) : a\n\n\nIt’s quite tedious to have to explicitly provide that first type\nargument to id . Implicit arguments and type inference will help,\nas we’ll see, next.\n\nLike many other languages in the tradition of Milner’s ML ,\ntype inference is a central component in F*’s design.\n\nYou may be used to type inference in other languages, where one can\nleave out type annotations (e.g., on variables, or when using\ntype-polymorphic (aka generic) functions) and the compiler determines\nan appropriate type based on the surrounding program context. F*’s\ntype inference includes such a feature, but is considerably more\npowerful. Like in other dependently typed language, F*’s inference\nengine is based on higher-order unification and can be used to infer arbitrary fragments of program text, not just\ntype annotations on variables.\n\nLet’s consider our simple example of the definition and use of the\nidentity function again\n\nlet id (a:Type) (x:a) : a = x\n\n\nlet _ : bool = id bool true\nlet _ : bool = id bool false\nlet _ : int = id int (-1)\nlet _ : nat = id nat 17\nlet _ : string = id string \"hello\"\nlet _ : int -> int = id (int -> int) (id int)\n\n\nInstead of explicitly providing that first type argument when applying id , one could write it as follows, replacing the type arguments\nwith an underscore _ .\n\nlet _ : bool = id _ true\nlet _ : bool = id _ false\nlet _ : int = id _ (-1)\nlet _ : nat = id _ 17\nlet _ : string = id _ \"hello\"\nlet _ : int -> int = id _ (id _)\n\n\nThe underscore symbols is a wildcard, or a hole in program, and it’s\nthe job of the F* typechecker to fill in the hole.\n\nNote\n\nProgram holes are a very powerful concept and form the basis of\nMeta-F*, the metaprogramming and tactics framework embedded in\nF*—we’ll see more about holes in a later section.\n\nSince it’s tedious to write an _ everywhere, F* has a notion of implicit arguments . That is, when defining a function, one can add\nannotations to indicate that certain arguments can be omitted at call\nsites and left for the typechecker to infer automatically.\n\nFor example, one could write\n\nlet id (#a:Type) (x:a) : a = x\n\n\ndecorating the\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>F*<|>ORGANIZATION<|>F* is a dependently typed programming language that treats programs and their types uniformly, featuring a Pure Type System (PTS) where types can have types and functions can take types as arguments and return types as results)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PURE TYPE SYSTEM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A type system where types themselves can be treated as first-class citizens, allowing for a high degree of abstraction and flexibility in programming languages like F*)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>C#<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A modern programming language that provides support for generic types)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JAVA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A widely-used programming language that offers generics to handle type polymorphism)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>C++<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A programming language known for its powerful template system for type polymorphism)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OCAML<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A programming language that supports several kinds of polymorphic types)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HASKELL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A functional programming language with advanced type polymorphism features)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>F*<|>PURE TYPE SYSTEM<|>F* implements a Pure Type System, allowing types to have types and functions to operate on types<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>C#<|>JAVA<|>Both C# and Java are modern programming languages that provide support for generic types, allowing for type polymorphism<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>C#<|>C++<|>C# and C++ both offer mechanisms (generics and templates, respectively) to handle type polymorphism<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JAVA<|>C++<|>Java and C++ are both programming languages that support type polymorphism, though through different mechanisms (generics and templates)<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OCAML<|>HASKELL<|>OCaml and Haskell both support advanced type polymorphism features, making them part of a group of languages with strong type systems<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

The calculus is based on a *Dijkstra Monad*, a\nconstruction first introduced in `this paper\n<https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/verifying-higher-order-programs-with-the-dijkstra-monad/>`_. In\nthis chapter, we will learn about Dijkstra Monad and its usage in\nspecifying and proving pure programs in F*.\n\nThe first main difference in adapting the Hoare triples and weakest\nprecondition computations that we saw earlier to the setting of F*'s\nfunctional language is that there are no global variables or mutable\nstate (we'll see about how model mutable state in F*'s effect system\nlater). Instead, each pure expression in F*'s *returns* a value and\nthe postconditions that we will manipulate are predicates about these\nvalues, rather than state predicates.\n\nTo illustrate, we sketch the definition of pure WPs below.\n\n.. code-block:: none\n\n  WP c Q                      = Q c \n  WP (let x = e1 in e2) Q     = WP e1 (fun x -> WP e2 Q)\n  WP (if e then e1 else e2) Q = (e ==> WP e1 Q) /\\ (~e ==> WP e2 Q)\n\n* The WP of a constant ``c`` is just the postcondition ``Q`` applied to ``c``.\n  \n* The WP of a ``let`` binding is a sequential composition of WPs,\n  applied to the *values* returned by each sub-expression\n\n* The WP of a condition is the WP of each branch, weakened by the\n  suitable branch condition, as before.\n\nThe F* type system internalizes and generalizes this WP construction\nto apply it to all F* terms. The form this takes is as a computation\ntype in F*, ``PURE a wp``, where in ``prims.fst``, ``PURE`` is defined\nas an F* primitive effect with a signature as shown below--we'll see\nmuch more of the ``new_effect`` syntax as we look at user-defined\neffects in subsequent chapters; for now, just see it as a reserved\nsyntax in F* to introduce a computation type constructor.\n\n.. code-block:: fstar\n\n   new_effect PURE (a:Type) (w:wp a) { ... }\n\nwhere\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Pure.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: wp$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: wp$                 \n\nA program ``e`` of type ``PURE a wp`` is a computation which\n\n  * Is defined only when ``wp (fun _ -> True)`` is valid\n\n  * If ``wp post`` is valid, then ``e`` terminates without any side\n    effects and returns a value ``v:a`` satisfying ``post v``.\n    \nNotice that ``wp a`` is the type of a function transforming\npostconditions (``a -> Type0``) to preconditions (``Type0``). [#]_ The\n``wp`` argument is also called an *index* of the ``PURE`` effect. [#]_\n\nThe return operator for ``wp a`` is shown below: it is analogous to\nthe ``WP c Q`` and ``WP x Q`` rules for variables and constants that\nwe showed earlier:\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Pure.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: return_wp$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: return_wp$                 \n                \nThe bind operator for ``wp a`` is analogous to the rule for sequencing\nWPs, i.e., the rule for ``WP (let x = e1 in e2) Q`` above:\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Pure.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: bind_wp$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: bind_wp$                 \n\nFinally, analogous to the WP rule for conditionals, one can write a\ncombinator for composing ``wp a`` in a branch:\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Pure.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: if_then_else_wp$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: if_then_else_wp$                 \n\n\nThis is the essence of the Dijkstra monad construction for pure\nprograms: the rule for computing weakest preconditions for a\ncomputation *returning* a value ``x`` is ``return_wp``; the rule for\ncomputing the WP of the sequential composition of terms is the\nsequential composition of WPs using ``bind_wp``; the rule for\ncomputing the WP of a conditional term is the conditional composition\nof WPs using ``if_then_else_wp``.\n\nIf fact, if one thinks of pure computations as the identity monad,\n``tot a`` as shown below:\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Pure.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: tot$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: tot$                 \n\nthen the parallel between the ``tot`` monad and ``wp`` becomes even\nclearer---the WP analog of ``return_tot`` is ``return_wp`` and of\n``bind_tot`` is ``bind_wp``.\n\nIt turns out that ``wp a`` (for monotonic weakest preconditions) is\nitself a monad, as shown below by a proof of the monad laws:\n\n.. literalinclude::\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>DIJKSTRA MONAD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A construction for reasoning about pure computations, introduced for specifying and proving pure programs in F*)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>F*<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A programming language that provides a weakest precondition calculus based on the Dijkstra Monad for pure computations)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PURE<|>EVENT<|>An F* primitive effect used in the context of pure computations to apply weakest precondition calculus)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DIJKSTRA MONAD<|>F*<|>The Dijkstra Monad is utilized within F* for specifying and proving pure programs<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PURE<|>F*<|>PURE is defined as an F* primitive effect for reasoning about pure computations<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PURE<|>DIJKSTRA MONAD<|>The PURE effect in F* is based on the concept of the Dijkstra Monad for reasoning about pure computations<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

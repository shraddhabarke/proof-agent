We write e : t to mean that a term e has type t . Many terms can have the\nsame type and the same term can have many types.\n\nOne (naive but useful) mental model is to think of a type as\ndescribing a set of values. For instance, the type int describes\nthe set of terms which compute integer results, i.e., when you have e : int , then when e is reduced fully it produces a value in\nthe set {..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ...} . Similarly, the type bool is the type of terms that compute or evaluate to one of the values in\nthe set {true,false} . Unlike many other languages, F* allows\ndefining types that describe arbitrary sets of values, e.g., the type\nthat contains only the number 17 , or the type of functions that\nfactor a number into its primes.\n\nWhen proving a program e correct, one starts by specifying the\nproperties one is interested in as a type t and then trying to\nconvince F* that e has type t , i.e., deriving e : t .\n\nThe idea of using a type to specify properties of a program has deep\nroots in the connections between logic and computation. You may find\nit interesting to read about propositions as types ,\na concept with many deep mathematical and philosophical\nimplications. For now, it suffices to think of a type t as a\nspecification, or a statement of a theorem, and e : t as\ncomputer-checkable claim that the term e is a proof of the theorem t .\n\nIn the next few chapters weâ€™ll learn about how to program total\nfunctions and prove them correct.\n\nContents:\n\n- Getting off the ground\n\n- Polymorphism and type inference\n\n- Equality\n\n- Interfacing with an SMT solver\n\n- Inductive types and pattern matching\n\n- Proofs of termination\n\n- Lemmas and proofs by induction\n\n- Case Study: Quicksort\n\n- Executing programs\n\n- Wrapping up\n\nÂ© Copyright 2020, Microsoft Research.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>F*<|>ORGANIZATION<|>F* is a programming language with a core design philosophy that the type of a term is a specification of its runtime behavior, allowing for programming and proving with total functions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MICROSOFT RESEARCH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Microsoft Research is the entity that holds the copyright for the document discussing programming and proving with total functions in F*)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>F*<|>MICROSOFT RESEARCH<|>Microsoft Research is likely involved in the development or research of the F* programming language, as indicated by the copyright notice<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

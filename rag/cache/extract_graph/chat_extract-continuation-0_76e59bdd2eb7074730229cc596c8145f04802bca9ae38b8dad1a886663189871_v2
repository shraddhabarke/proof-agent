In particular, for a Merkle tree containing :math:`2^n` data\nitems, it only takes :math:`n` hash computations to prove that a\nparticular item is in the tree.\n\nIn this section, we build a very simple, but canonical, Merkle tree\nand prove it correct and cryptographically secure. And we'll use\nseveral indexed inductive types to do it. Thanks to Aseem Rastogi for\nthis example!\n\nSetting\n.......\n\nMerkle trees have many applications. To motivate our presentation\nhere, consider the following simple scenario.\n\nA content provider (someone like, say, the New York Times) has a large\narchive of digital artifacts---documents, multimedia files, etc. These\nartifacts are circulated among users, but when receiving an artifact\none may question its authenticity. One way to ensure the authenticity\nof received artifacts is for the content provider to use a digital\nsignature based on a public-key cryptosystem and for users to verify\nthese signatures upon receiving an artifact. However, signatures can\nbe quite heavyweight for certain applications.\n\nInstead, the content provider can organize their archive into a Merkle\ntree, a tree of hashes with the artifacts themselves stored at the\nleaves, such that a single hash associated with the root node of the\ntree authenticates *all* the artifacts in the tree. By publishing just\nthis root hash, and associating with each artifact a path in the tree\nfrom the root to it, a skeptical client can quickly check using a\nsmall number of hash computations (logarithmic in the size of the\nentire archive) whether or not a given artifact is authentic (by\nrecomputing the root hash and checking if it matches the known\npublished root hash).\n\n\nIntuitions\n..........\n\nOur Merkle tree will be a full binary tree of height :math:`n` storing\n:math:`2^n` data items and their corresponding hashes at the\nnodes. The main idea of a Merkle tree is for each internal node to\nalso maintain a *hash of the hashes* stored at each of its\nchildren. If the hash algorithm being used is cryptographically\nsecure, in the sense that it is collision resistant (i.e., it is\ncomputationally hard to find two strings that hash to the same value),\nthen the hash associated with the root node authenticates the content\nof the entire tree.\n\nInformally, a Merkle tree is an authenticated data structure in that\nit is computationally hard to tamper with any of the data items in the\ntree while still producing the same root hash. Further, to prove that\na particular data item ``d`` is in the tree, it suffices to provide\nthe hashes associated with the nodes in the path from the root to that\nthe leaf containing that item ``d``, and one can easily check by\ncomparing hashes that the claimed path is accurate. In fact, we can\nprove that if a claimed path through the tree attests to the presence\nof some other item ``d' <> d``, then we can construct a collision on\nthe underlying hash algorithm---this property will be our main proof of\nsecurity.\n\n\nPreliminaries\n.............\n\nWe'll model the resources and the hashes we store in our tree as\nstrings of characters. F* standard library ``FStar.String`` provides\nsome utilities to work with strings.\n\nIn the code listing below, we define the following\n\n  * ``lstring n``, the type of strings of length ``n``. Like the\n    ``vec`` type, ``lstring`` is a length-indexed type; unlike\n    ``vector`` it is defined using a refinement type rather than an\n    indexed inductive type. Defining indexed types using refinements\n    is quite common in F*.\n\n  * ``concat``, a utility to concatenate strings, with its type\n    proving that the resulting string's length is the sum of the lengths\n    of the input strings.\n\n  * ``hash_size`` and ``hash``, a parameter of our development\n    describing the length in characters of a ``hash`` function. The F*\n    keyword ``assume`` allows you to assume the existence of a symbol\n    at a given type. Use it with care, since you can trivially prove\n    anything by including an ``assume nonsense : False``.\n\n  * The type of resources we store in the tree will just be\n    ``resource``, an alias for ``string``.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/MerkleTree.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: preliminaries\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: preliminaries\n\n\nDefining the Merkle tree\n........................\n\nThe inductive type ``mtree`` below defines our Merkle tree.

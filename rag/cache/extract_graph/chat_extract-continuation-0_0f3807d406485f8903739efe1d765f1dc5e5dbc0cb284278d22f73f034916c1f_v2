[#]_\n\nThe library function ``FStar.Ghost.Pull.pull`` can help in such\nsituatinos. It has the following signature:\n\n.. code-block:: fstar\n\n   val pull (#a:Type) (#b:a -> Type) (f: (x:a -> GTot (b x)))\n     : GTot (x:a -> b x)\n\n   val pull_equiv (#a:Type) (#b:a -> Type) (f: (x:a -> GTot (b x))) (x:a)\n     : Lemma (ensures pull f x == f x)\n             [SMTPat (pull f x)]\n               \n                \nThis type states that for any ghost function ``f``, we can exhibit a\ntotal function ``g`` with the same type as ``f``, while the lemma\n``pull_equiv`` states that ``g`` is pointwise equal to ``f``. [#]_ However,\nit may not be possible, in general, to compute ``g`` in a way that\nenables it to be compiled by F*. So, ``pull f`` itself has ghost\neffect, indicating that applications of ``pull`` cannot be used in\ncompilable code.\n\nUsing ``pull``, one can write ``map (pull factorial) [0;1;2] : GTot\n(list nat)``, thereby reusing ghost functions where total functions\nare expected.\n\n.. [#] F* does not have any built-in support for effect-label\n       polymorphism. That is, one cannot write a type like this: ``map\n       #a #b #e (f: a -> e b) (l:list a) : e (list b)``, where ``e``\n       is an effect variable. However, using F*'s dependent types, one\n       can code up various `ad hoc forms of effect polymorphism\n       <../code/AdHocEffectPolymorphism.fst>`_. Some other languages\n       with effect systems, notably `Koka\n       <https://koka-lang.github.io/koka/doc/index.html>`_, do support\n       effect polymorphism primitively.\n\n.. [#] The ``SMTPat`` annotation on the ``pull_equiv`` lemma instructs\n       F* to allow Z3 to instantiate this lemma automatically. You\n       can learn more :ref:`about SMT patterns and quantifier\n       instantiation in a later chapter <UTH_smt>`.\n       \nRevisiting Vector Concatenation\n-------------------------------\n\nWe now have all the ingredients to understand how the vector append\nexample shown at the start of this chapter works. Here, below, is a\nversion of the same code with all the implicit arguments and\nreveal/hide operations made explicit.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/VecErasedExplicit.fst\n   :language: fstar\n\n**Definition of vec**\n\nIn the definition of the inductive type ``vec a``, we have two\noccurrences of ``reveal``. Consider ``vec a (reveal n)``, the type of\nthe ``tl`` of the vector. ``reveal n`` is a ghost computation of type\n``GTot nat``, so ``vec a (reveal n) : GTot Type``. But, since ``Type``\nis non-informative, ``GTot Type`` is promoted to ``Tot Type``. The\npromotion from ``GTot Type`` to ``Tot Type`` is pervasive in F* and\nenables ghost computations to be freely used in types and other\nspecifications.\n\nThe ``vec a (reveal n + 1)`` in the result type of ``Cons`` is\nsimilar. Here ``reveal n + 1`` has type ``GTot nat``, but applying it\nto ``vec a`` produces a ``GTot Type``, which is promoted to ``Tot\nType``.\n\n**Type of append**\n\nThe type of ``append`` has four occurrences of ``reveal``. Three of\nthem, in the type of ``v0``, ``v1``, and the return type behave the\nsame as the typing the fields of ``Cons``: the ``GTot Type`` is\npromoted to ``Tot Type``.\n\nOne additional wrinkle is in the decreases clause, where we have an\nexplicit ``reveal n``, since what decreases on each recursive call is\nthe ``nat`` that's in bijection with the parameter ``n``, rather than\n``n`` itself. When F* infers a decreases clause for a function, any\nerased terms in the clause are automatically revealed.\n\n**Definition of append**\n\nThe recursive call instantiates the index parameters to ``n_tl`` and\n``m``, which are both erased.\n\nWhen constructing the ``Cons`` node, its index argument is\ninstantiated to ``hide (reveal n_tl + reveal m)``. The needless\naddition is marked with a ``hide`` enabling that F* compiler to erase\nit. As we saw before in ``factorial_tail_alt``, using ``hide`` allows\none to mingle ghost computations (like ``(reveal n - 1)``) with total\ncomputations, as needed for specifications and proofs.\n\nAll of this is painfully explicit, but the implicit reveal/hide\ncoercions inserted by F* go a long way towards make things relatively\nsmooth.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>FSTAR.GHOST.PULL.PULL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A library function in F* that transforms ghost functions into total functions, enabling their reuse in contexts where total functions are expected)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FSTAR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A programming language that supports dependent types, designed to enable formal verification of programs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PULL_EQUIV<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A lemma in F* that asserts the pointwise equality of a ghost function and its total function counterpart generated by the pull function)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Z3<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A theorem prover used by F* to automatically instantiate lemmas, such as pull_equiv, through the SMTPat annotation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KOKA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A programming language that supports effect polymorphism primitively, unlike F*)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FSTAR.GHOST.PULL.PULL<|>FSTAR<|>The pull function is part of F*'s library, designed to work with its type system and verification capabilities<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PULL_EQUIV<|>FSTAR.GHOST.PULL.PULL<|>pull_equiv is a lemma related to the pull function, demonstrating its effect on ghost functions<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Z3<|>PULL_EQUIV<|>Z3 is used by F* to automatically instantiate the pull_equiv lemma, indicating a direct application of Z3 in F*'s verification process<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KOKA<|>FSTAR<|>Koka is mentioned in contrast to F* for its native support of effect polymorphism, highlighting differences in language capabilities<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

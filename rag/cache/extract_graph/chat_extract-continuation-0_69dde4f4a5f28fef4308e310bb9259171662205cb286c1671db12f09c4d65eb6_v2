The term ``e``\n*refines* the type ``t``, in the sense that the set ``S`` denoted by ``t``\nis restricted to those elements ``x`` :math:`\\in` ``S``  for which ``e`` evaluates to\n``true``.\n\nThat is, the type ``nat`` describes the set of terms that evaluate to an\nelement of the set ``{0, 1, 2, 3, ...}``.\n\nBut, there's nothing particularly special about ``nat``. You can define\narbitrary refinements of your choosing, e.g.,\n\n.. code-block:: fstar\n\n  let empty = x:int { false } //the empty set\n  let zero = x:int{ x = 0 } //the type containing one element `0`\n  let pos = x:int { x > 0 } //the positive numbers\n  let neg = x:int { x < 0 } //the negative numbers\n  let even = x:int { x % 2 = 0 } //the even numbers\n  let odd = x:int { x % 2 = 1 } //the odd numbers\n\nIf you're coming from a language like C or Java where a type primarily\ndescribes some properties about the representation of data in memory,\nthis view of types as describing arbitrary sets of values may feel a\nbit alien. But, let it sink in a bit---types that carve out precise\nsets of values will let you state and check invariants about your\nprograms that may otherwise have only been implicit in your code.\n\n.. note::\n\n   Refinement types in F* trace their lineage to `F7\n   <https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/f7-refinement-types-for-f/>`_,\n   a language developed at Microsoft Research c. 2007 -- 2011. `Liquid\n   Haskell <https://ucsd-progsys.github.io/liquidhaskell-blog/>`_ is\n   another language with refinement types. Those languages provide\n   additional background and resources for learning about refinement\n   types.\n\n   Boolean refinements are a special case of a more powerful form of\n   propositional refinement type in F*. Refinement types, in\n   conjunction with dependent function types, are, in principle,\n   sufficient to encode many kinds of logics for program\n   correctness. However, refinement types are just one among several\n   tools in F* for program specification and proof.\n\n\nRefinement subtyping\n....................\n\nWe have seen so far how to define a new refinement type, like ``nat`` or\n``even``. However, to make use of refinement types we need rules that\nallow us to:\n\n1. check that a program term has a given refinement type, e.g., to\n   check that ``0`` has type ``nat``. This is sometimes called\n   *introducing* a refinement type.\n\n2. make use of a term that has a refinement type, e.g., given ``x :\n   even`` we would like to be able to write ``x + 1``, treating ``x`` as an\n   ``int`` to add ``1`` to it. This is sometimes called *eliminating*\n   a refinement type.\n\nThe technical mechanism in F* that supports both these features is\ncalled *refinement subtyping*.\n\nIf you're used to a language like Java, C# or some other\nobject-oriented language, you're familiar with the idea of\nsubtyping. A type ``t`` is a subtype of ``s`` whenever a program term\nof type ``t`` can be safely treated as an ``s``. For example, in Java,\nall object types are subtypes of the type ``Object``, the base class\nof all objects.\n\nFor boolean refinement types, the subtyping rules are as follows:\n\n* The type ``x:t { p }`` is a subtype of ``t``. That is, given ``e :\n  (x:t{p})``, it is always safe to *eliminate* the refinement and\n  consider ``e`` to also have type ``t``.\n\n* For a term ``e`` of type ``t`` (i.e., ``e : t``), ``t`` is a subtype\n  of the boolean refinement type ``x:t { p }`` whenever ``p[e / x]``\n  (``p[e/x]`` is notation for the term ``p`` with the variable ``x``\n  replaced by ``e``), is provably equal to ``true``. In other words,\n  to *introduce* ``e : t`` at the boolean refinement type ``x:t{ p\n  }``, it suffices to prove that the term ``p`` with ``e`` substituted\n  for bound variable ``x``, evaluates to ``true``.\n\nThe elimination rule for refinement types (i.e., the first part above)\nis simple---with our intuition of types as sets, the refinement type\n``x:t{ p }`` *refines* the set corresponding\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PRIMS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The F* core library that defines the type of natural numbers and other boolean refinement types)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NAT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A type in F* that describes the set of non-negative integers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EMPTY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A type in F* representing the empty set)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ZERO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A type in F* representing the set containing only the number 0)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>POS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A type in F* representing the set of all positive numbers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEG<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A type in F* representing the set of all negative numbers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EVEN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A type in F* representing the set of all even numbers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ODD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A type in F* representing the set of all odd numbers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>F7<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A language developed at Microsoft Research that influenced F* refinement types)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LIQUID HASKELL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A language with refinement types providing additional resources for learning about refinement types)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NAT<|>PRIMS<|>NAT is a type defined within the Prims library of F*<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EMPTY<|>PRIMS<|>EMPTY is a type defined within the Prims library of F*<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ZERO<|>PRIMS<|>ZERO is a type defined within the Prims library of F*<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>POS<|>PRIMS<|>POS is a type defined within the Prims library of F*<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NEG<|>PRIMS<|>NEG is a type defined within the Prims library of F*<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EVEN<|>PRIMS<|>EVEN is a type defined within the Prims library of F*<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ODD<|>PRIMS<|>ODD is a type defined within the Prims library of F*<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>F7<|>LIQUID HASKELL<|>Both F7 and Liquid Haskell are languages that influenced the development of refinement types in F*<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

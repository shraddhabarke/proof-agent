Given the constraints and the nature of the text provided, it appears there were misunderstandings in the initial extraction. The text primarily discusses concepts and features within the F* programming language, focusing on functional extensionality, decidable equality, and related theoretical concepts rather than concrete organizations, persons, geographical locations, or events in the conventional sense. \n\nHowever, based on the instructions and aiming to correct the oversight, let's attempt to identify entities more accurately within the given context, though it's important to note that the text primarily deals with abstract programming concepts which may not neatly fit into the specified entity types. Given the abstract nature of the content, there might be limitations to the entities and relationships that can be extracted according to the provided entity types (organization, person, geo, event).\n\nConsidering the text's focus on programming concepts and the F* language's features, without specific mentions of organizations, persons, geographical locations, or events in the conventional sense, it's challenging to add more entities and relationships without deviating from the text's content. The text discusses programming constructs, theoretical concepts, and the functionality of the F* language, which do not directly correspond to the entity types specified in the task.\n\nIf the task were to include abstract concepts or components of a programming language as entities, we could consider entities such as \"functional extensionality,\" \"decidable equality,\" or specific features of the F* language as \"entities\" under a more loosely interpreted \"organization\" or \"event\" category, representing organized concepts or significant theoretical events in programming language theory. However, such interpretations would stretch beyond the conventional understanding of the specified entity types.\n\nGiven these constraints, and without further context or a broader interpretation of the entity types, it's challenging to provide additional entities and relationships that accurately reflect the content of the provided text.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1742951612, "model": "gpt-4-0125-preview", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 370, "prompt_tokens": 3411, "total_tokens": 3781, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.\n \n-Steps-\n1.

However, from ``ax #pos f g`` we gain that\n``f == g``, and in particular that ``f 0 == g 0``, which is false.\n\n.. note::\n\n   The trouble arises in part because although ``ax:funext`` proves\n   ``squash (equals #(pos -> int) f g)``, F*'s encoding of the\n   equality to the SMT solver (whose equality is untyped) treats the\n   equality as ``squash (equals #(nat -> int) f g)``, which leads to\n   the contradiction.\n\nFurther, :math:`\\eta`-equivalent functions in F* are not considered\nprovably equal.

If so, the type is considered an ``eqtype`` and uses of the ``(\n= )`` operator are compiled at runtime to structural comparison of\nvalues provided by the target language chosen, e.g., OCaml, F\\#, or C.\n\nThe criterion used to determine whether or not the type supports\nequality decidable is the following.\n\nGiven an inductive type definition of :math:`T` with parameters\n:math:`\\overline{p}` and indexes :math:`~\\overline{q}`, for each\nconstructor of :math:`D` with arguments :math:`\\overline{v:t_v}`,\n\n1.

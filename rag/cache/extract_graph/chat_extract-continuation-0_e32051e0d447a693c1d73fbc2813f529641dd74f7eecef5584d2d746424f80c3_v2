Given the constraints and the nature of the text, it appears there was a misunderstanding in identifying relevant entities and relationships from the provided code snippet. The text primarily deals with computational concepts and functions rather than entities typically categorized under organization, person, geo, or event. The entities and relationships extracted were based on an attempt to interpret these computational elements within the given framework, which may not align with the expected output for entities of the specified types.\n\nGiven the nature of the text, which is highly technical and specific to programming or software development concepts, it does not contain explicit references to organizations, persons, geographical locations, or events in the conventional sense. Therefore, accurately identifying entities of the specified types and their relationships within this context is challenging and may not be feasible without reinterpreting the text beyond its literal content.\n\nIf the task is to identify entities and relationships within a technical or programming context using the specified entity types, it may require a reassessment of the criteria for what constitutes an entity or relationship within this specialized domain.

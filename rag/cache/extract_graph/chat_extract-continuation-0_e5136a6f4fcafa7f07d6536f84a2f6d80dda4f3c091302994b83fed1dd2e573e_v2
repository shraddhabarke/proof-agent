In this section, we take a closer look\nat these logical connectives, show their definitions, and present some\nutilities to manipulate them in proofs.\n\nEvery logical connective comes in two flavors. First, in its most\nprimitive form, it is defined as an inductive or arrow type, giving a\nconstructive interpretation to the connective. Second, and more\ncommonly used in F*, is a *squashed*, or proof-irrelevant, variant of\nthe same connective---the squashed variant is classical rather than\nconstructive and its proofs are typically derived by writing partial\nproof terms with the SMT filling in the missing parts.\n\nEach connective has an *introduction* principle (which describes how\nto build proofs of that connective) and an *elimination* principle\n(which describes how to use a proof of that connective to build other\nproofs). Example uses of introduction and elimination principles for\nall the connectives can be found in `ClassicalSugar.fst\n<https://github.com/FStarLang/FStar/blob/master/tests/micro-benchmarks/ClassicalSugar.fst>`_\n\nAll these types are defined in ``Prims``, the very first module in all\nF* programs.\n\nFalsehood\n.........\n\nThe ``empty`` inductive type is the proposition that has no\nproofs. The logical consistency of F* depends on there being no closed\nterms whose type is ``empty``.\n\n.. code-block:: fstar\n\n   type empty =\n\nThis definition might look odd at first: it defines an inductive type\nwith *zero* constructors. This is perfectly legal in F*, unlike in\nlanguages like OCaml or F#.\n\nThe squashed variant of ``empty`` is called ``False`` and is defined\nas shown below:\n\n.. code-block:: fstar\n\n   let False = squash empty\n\nIntroduction\n++++++++++++\n\nThe ``False`` proposition has no introduction form, since it has no proofs.\n\nElimination\n+++++++++++\n\nFrom a (hypothetical) proof of ``False``, one can build a proof of any\nother type.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Connectives.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: empty_elim$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: empty_elim$\n\nThis body of ``elim_false`` is a ``match`` expression with no branches,\nwhich suffices to match all the zero cases of the ``empty`` type.\n\n``FStar.Pervasives.false_elim`` provides an analogous elimination rule\nfor ``False``, as shown below, where the termination check for the\nrecursive call succeeds trivially in a context with ``x:False``.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Connectives.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: false_elim$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: false_elim$\n\nTruth\n.....\n\nThe ``trivial`` inductive type has just a single proof, ``T``.\n\n.. code-block::\n\n   type trivial = T\n\n.. note::\n\n   Although isomorphic to the ``unit`` type with its single element\n   ``()``, for historic reasons, F* uses the ``trivial`` type to\n   represent trivial proofs. In the future, it is likely that\n   ``trivial`` will just be replaced by ``unit``.\n\nThe squashed form of ``trivial`` is written ``True`` and is defined as:\n\n.. code-block::\n\n   let True = squash trivial\n\nIntroduction\n++++++++++++\n\nThe introduction forms for both the constructive and squashed variants\nare trivial.\n\n.. code-block::\n\n   let _ : trivial = T\n   let _ : True = ()\n\nElimination\n+++++++++++\n\nThere is no elimination form, since proofs of ``trivial`` are vacuous\nand cannot be used to derive any other proofs.\n\n\nConjunction\n...........\n\nA constructive proof of ``p`` and ``q`` is just a pair containing\nproofs of ``p`` and ``q``, respectively.\n\n.. code-block::\n\n   type pair (p q:Type) = | Pair : _1:p -> _2:q -> pair p q\n\n.. note::\n\n   This type is isomorphic to the tuple type ``p & q`` that we\n   encountered previously :ref:`here <Part1_tuples>`. F* currently\n   uses a separate type for pairs used in proofs and those used to\n   pair data, though there is no fundamental reason for this. In the\n   future, it is likely that ``pair`` will just be replaced by the\n   regular tuple type.\n\nThe squashed form of conjunction is written ``/\\`` and is defined as\nfollows:\n\n.. code-block::\n\n   let ( /\\ ) (p q:Type) = squash (pair p q)\n\nIntroduction\n++++++++++++\n\nIntroducing a conjunction simply involves constructing a pair.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Connectives.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: and_intro$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: and_intro$\n\nTo introduce the squashed version, there are two options.

The semantics of ``WP`` is that ``WP (c, Q)``\nis the weakest precondition that should hold before executing ``c``\nfor the postcondition ``Q`` to be valid after executing ``c``. Thus,\nthe function ``WP`` assigns meaning to programs as a transformer of\npostconditions ``Q`` to preconditions ``WP (s, Q)``.\n\nThe ``wp`` function for our small imperative language is shown below:\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Imp.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: wp$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: wp$\n\n* The case of ``Assign`` is identical to the ``assignment`` lemma\n  shown earlier.\n\n* The case of ``Seq`` sequentially composes the wp's. That is, to\n  prove the ``post`` after running ``p1 ;; p2`` we need to prove ``wp\n  p2 post`` after running ``p1``. It may be helpful to read this case\n  as the equivalent form ``fun s0 -> wp p1 (fun s1 -> wp p2 post s1)\n  s0``, where ``s0`` is the initial state and ``s1`` is the state that\n  results after running just ``p1``.\n  \n* The ``If`` case computes the WPs for each branch and requires them\n  to be proven under the suitable branch condition.\n\n* The ``Repeat`` case is most interesting: it involves an\n  existentially quantified invariant ``inv``, which is the loop\n  invariant. That is, to reason about ``Repeat n p``, one has to\n  somehow find an invariant ``inv`` that is true initially, and\n  implies both the WP of the loop body as well as the final\n  postcondition.\n\nThe ``wp`` function is sound in the sense that it computes a\nsufficient precondition, as proven by the following lemma.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Imp.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: wp_soundness$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: wp_soundness$\n\nOne could also prove that ``wp`` computes the weakest precondition,\ni.e., if ``triple p c q`` then ``forall s. p s ==> wp c q s``, though\nwe do not prove that formally here.\n  \nA Sample Program Proof\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n  \nWe now illustrate some sample proofs using our Hoare triples and\n``wp`` function. To emphasize that Hoare triples provide an *abstract*\nway of reasoning about the execution of programs, we define the\n``hoare p c q`` an alias for ``triple p c q`` marked with an attribute\nto ensure that F* and Z3 cannot reason directly about the underlying\ndefinition of ``triple``---that would allow Z3 to find proofs by\nreasoning about the operational semantics directly, which we want to\navoid , since it would not scale to larger programs. For more about\nthe ``opaque_to_smt`` and ``reveal_opaque`` construct, please see\n:ref:`this section on opaque definitions <UTH_opaque_to_smt>`.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Imp.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: hoare$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: hoare$\n\nThe lemmas above are just restatements of the ``wp_soundness`` and\n``consequence`` lemmas that we've already proven. Now, these are the\nonly two lemmas we have to reason about the ``hoare p c q`` predicate.\n\nNext, we define some notation to make it a bit more convenient to\nwrite programs in our small language.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Imp.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: notation$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: notation$\n\nFinally, we can build proofs of some simple, loop-free programs\nautomatically by computing their ``wp`` using ``wp_hoare`` and\napplying ``hoare_consequence`` to get F* and Z3 to prove that the\ninferred WP is implied by the annotated precondition.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Imp.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: swap$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: swap$\n\nThis recipe of computing verification conditions using WPs and then\nchecking the computed WP against the annotated specification using a\nsolver like Z3 is a very common and powerful pattern. In fact, as\nwe'll see below, the methodology that we've developed here for our\nsmall imperative language is exactly what the F* typechecker does (at\na larger scale and for the whole F* language) when checking an F*\nprogram.\n\n  \nThe ``PURE`` Effect: A Dijkstra Monad for Pure Computations\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nF* provides a weakest precondition calculus for reasoning about pure\ncomputations. The calculus is based on a *Dijkstra Monad*, a\nconstruction first introduced in `this paper\n<https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/verifying-higher-order-programs-with-the-dijkstra-monad/>`_.

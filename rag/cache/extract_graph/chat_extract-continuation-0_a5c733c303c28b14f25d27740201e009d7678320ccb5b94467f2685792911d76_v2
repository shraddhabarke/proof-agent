For example, here's the type of lists parameterized by a type\n``a`` of the list elements.\n\n.. code-block:: fstar\n\n   type list a =\n     | Nil  : list a\n     | Cons : hd:a -> tl:list a -> list a\n\nWe also saw that it was easy to define basic functions over these\ntypes, using pattern matching and recursion. For example, here's\na function to compute the length of a list.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Part1.Inductives.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: length\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: length\n\nThe function ``length`` defines some property of a ``list`` (its\nlength) separately from the definition of the ``list`` type itself.\nSometimes, however, it can be convenient to define a property of a\ntype together with the type itself. For example, in some situations,\nit may be natural to define the length of the list together with the\ndefinition of the list type itself, so that every list is structurally\nequipped with a notion of its length. Here's how:\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Vec.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: SNIPPET_START: vec\n   :end-before: SNIPPET_END: vec\n\nWhat we have here is our first indexed type, ``vec a n``. One way to\nunderstand this definition is that ``vec a : nat -> Type`` describes a\nfamily of types, ``vec a 0``, ``vec a 1``, ... etc., all representing\nlists of ``a``-typed elements, but where the *index* ``n`` describes\nthe length of the list. With this definition of ``vec``, the function\n``length`` is redundant: given a ``v : vec a n`` we know that its\n``length v`` is ``n``, without having to recompute it.\n\nThis style of enriching a type definition with indexes to state\nproperties of the type is reminiscent of what we learned earlier about\n:ref:`intrinsic versus extrinsic proofs\n<Part1_intrinsic_extrinsic>`. Rather than defining a single type\n``list a`` for all lists and then separatately (i.e., extrinsically)\ndefining a function ``length`` to compute the length of a list, with\n``vec`` we've enriched the type of the list intrinsically, so that\ntype of ``vec`` immediately tells you its length.\n\nNow, you may have seen examples like this length-indexed ``vec`` type\nbefore---it comes up often in tutorials about dependently typed\nprogramming. But, indexed types can do a lot more. In this section we\nlearn about indexed inductive types from three related perspectives:\n\n  * Representing data: Inductive types allow us to build new data\n    types, includes lists, vectors, trees, etc. in several flavors.\n    We present two case studies: :ref:`vectors <Part2_vectors>` and\n    :ref:`Merkle trees <Part2_merkle>`, a binary tree data structure\n    equipped with cryptographic proofs.\n\n  * Representing proofs: The core logic of F* rests upon several\n    simple inductive type definitions. We revisit the logical\n    connectives we've seen before (including the :ref:`propositional\n    connectives <Part2_connectives>` and :ref:`equality\n    <Part2_equality>`) and show how rather than being primitive\n    notions in F*, their definitions arise from a few core\n    constructions involving inductive type. Other core notions in the\n    language, including the handling of :ref:`termination proofs\n    <Part1_termination>`, can also be understood in terms of inductive\n    types that :ref:`model well-founded recursion\n    <Part2_well_founded_recursion>`.\n\n  * Representing computations: Inductive type definitions allow\n    embedding other programming languages or computational models\n    within F*. We develop two case studies.\n\n    + We develop a :ref:`deep embedding of the simply-typed lambda\n      calculus <Part2_stlc>` with several reduction strategies, and a\n      proof of its syntactic type soundness. The example showcases the\n      use of several inductive types to represent the syntax of a\n      programming language, a relation describing its type system, and\n      another relation describing its operational semantics.\n\n    + We also show how to use :ref:`higher-order abstract syntax\n      <Part2_phoas>` to represent well-typed lambda terms, a concise\n      style that illustrates how to use inductive types that store\n      functions.\n\n    + Finally, we look at a :ref:`shallow embedding of an imperative\n      programming language with structured concurrency <Part2_par>`,\n      representing computations as infinitely branching inductively\n      defined trees. The example introduces modeling computational\n      effects as monads and showcases the use of inductive types\n      at higher order.\n\nThis section is somewhat more advanced than the first. It also\ninterleaves some technical material about F*'s core logic with case\nstudies showing some of those core concepts at work. You can certainly\nwork through the material sequentially, but\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>F*<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A programming language focused on inductive definitions and proving properties of programs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LIST<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A data type in F* for representing sequences of elements)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VEC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An indexed type in F* representing lists with their length encoded in the type)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MERKLE TREES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A binary tree data structure equipped with cryptographic proofs, discussed in F*)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LIST<|>F*<|>Lists are a fundamental data type used in F* for representing sequences<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VEC<|>LIST<|>Vec is an advanced form of List in F* that includes the length of the list in its type<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MERKLE TREES<|>F*<|>Merkle Trees are used in F* as a case study for representing data with cryptographic proofs<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

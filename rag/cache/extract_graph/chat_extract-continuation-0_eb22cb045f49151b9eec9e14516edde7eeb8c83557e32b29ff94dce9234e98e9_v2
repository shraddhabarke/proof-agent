So, all the data construtors\nconstruct the same instance of the type constructor. Further, all\ndata constructors take at most one argument. If your datatype\nhappens to be simple enough to fit these restrictions, you can use\na notation similar to OCaml or F* for those types in F*. For\nexample, here’s the option type defined in F* using an\nOCaml-like notation.\n\ntype option a =\n  | None\n  | Some of a\n\n\nThis is equivalent to\n\ntype option a =\n  | None : option a\n  | Some : a -> option a\n\n\nWith our length-indexed vec type, one can write functions with\ntypes that make use of the length information to ensure that they are\nwell-defined. For example, to get the i th element of a vector, one\ncan write:\n\nlet rec get #a #n (i:nat{i < n}) (v:vec a n)\n  : a\n  = match v with\n    | Nil -> false_elim()\n    | Cons hd tl ->\n      if i = 0 then hd\n      else get (i - 1) tl\n\n\nThe type of get i v says that i must be less than n , where n is the length of v , i.e., that i is within bounds of the\nvector, which is enough to prove that get i v can always return an\nelement of type a . Let’s look a bit more closely at how this\nfunction is typechecked by F*.\n\nThe first key bit is pattern matching v :\n\nmatch v with\n| Nil -> false_elim()\n| Cons hd tl ->\n\n\nIn case v is Nil , we use the library function Prims.false_elim : squash False -> a to express that this case is\nimpossible. Intuitively, since the index i is a natural number\nstrictly less than the length of the list, we should be able to\nconvince F* that n <> 0 .\n\nThe way this works is that F* typechecks the branch in a context that\nincludes an equation , namely that the v : vec a n equals the\npattern Nil : vec a 0 . With the assumption that v == Nil in\nthe context, F* tries to check that false_elim is well-typed,\nwhich in turn requires () : squash False . This produces an proof\nobligation sent to the SMT solver, which is able to prove False in\nthis case, since from v = Nil we must have that n = 0 which\ncontradicts i < n . Put another way, the branch where v = Nil is unreachable given the precondition i < n .\n\nNote\n\nWhen a branch is unreachable, F* allows you to just omit the branch\naltogether, rather than writing it an explicitly calling false_elim . For example, it is more common to write:\n\nlet rec get #a #n (i:nat{i < n}) (v:vec a n)\n  : a\n  = let Cons hd tl = v in\n    if i = 0 then hd\n    else get (i - 1) tl\n\n\nwhere let Cons hd tl = v pattern matches v against just Cons hd tl . F* automatically proves that the other cases of\nthe match are unreachable.\n\nNow, turning to the second case, we have a pattern like this:\n\nmatch v with\n| Cons hd tl ->\n\n\nBut, recall that Cons has an implicit first argument describing\nthe length of tl . So, more explicitly, our pattern is of the form\nbelow, where tl : vec a m .\n\nmatch v with\n| Cons #m hd tl ->\n\n\nF* typechecks the branch in a context that includes the equation that v == Cons #m hd tl , which lets the solve conclude that n == m + 1 , from the type of Cons .\n\nIf i=0 , we’ve found the element we want and return it.\n\nOtherwise, we make a recursive call get (i - 1) tl and now F* has\nto:\n\n- Instantiate the implicit argument of get to m , the length\nof tl . That is, in explicit form, this recursive call is\nreally get #m (i - 1) tl . F* does this by relying on a\nunification algorithm implemented as part of its type inference\nprocedure.\n\n- Prove that (i - 1) < m , which follows from i < n and n == m + 1 .\n\n- Prove that the recursive call terminates, by proving that m << n , or, equivalently, since m and n are natural numbers, m < n . This is easy, since we have n == m + 1 .\n\nLet’s try a few exercises. The main work is to find a type for the\nfunctions in question. Once you do, the rest of the code will “write\nitself”.\n\nClick here for the exercise file.\n\nImplement a function to concatenate vectors. It should have the\nfollowing signature:\n\nval append (#a:Type) (#n #m:nat) (v1:vec a n) (v2:vec a m)\n  : vec a (n + m)\n\n\nAnswer\n\nlet rec append #a #n #m (v1:vec a n) (v2:vec a m)\n  : vec a (n + m)\n  = match v1 with\n    | Nil -> v2\n    | Cons hd tl -> Cons hd (append tl v2)\n\n\nWrite a function called split_at to split a vector v : vec a n at index i into its i -length prefix from position 0 and a\nsuffix starting at i .\n\nAnswer\n\nlet rec split_at #a #\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

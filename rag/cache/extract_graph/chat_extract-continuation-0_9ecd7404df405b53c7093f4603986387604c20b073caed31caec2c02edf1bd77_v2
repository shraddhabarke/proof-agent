This\nexample illustrates the flexibility of typeclasses, including\ntypeclasses for types that themselves are indexed by other\ntypeclasses.\n\nThe main idea of a graded monad is to index a monad with a monoid,\nwhere the monoid index characterizes some property of interest of the\nmonadic computation.\n\nA monoid is a typeclass for an algebraic structure with a single\nassociative binary operation and a unit element for that\noperation. A simple instance of a monoid is the natural numbers with\naddition and the unit being 0 .\n\nclass monoid (a:Type) =\n{\n   op   : a -> a -> a;\n   one  : a;\n   properties: squash (\n     (forall (x:a). op one x == x /\\ op x one == x) /\\\n     (forall (x y z:a). op x (op y z) == op (op x y) z)\n   );\n}\n\ninstance monoid_nat_plus : monoid nat =\n{\n  op = (fun (x y:nat) -> x + y);\n  one = 0;\n  properties = ()\n}\n\n\nA graded monad is a type constructor m indexed by a monoid as\ndescribed by the class below. In other words, m is equipped with\ntwo operations:\n\n- a return , similar to the return of a monad, but whose\nindex is the unit element of the monoid\n\n- a ( let+ ) , similar to the ( let! ) of a monad, but whose\naction on the indexes corresponds to the binary operator of the\nindexing monoid.\n\nclass graded_monad (#index:Type) {| monoid index |}\n                   (m : index -> Type -> Type) = \n{\n  return : #a:Type -> x:a -> m one a;\n  \n   ( let+ )   : #a:Type -> #b:Type -> #ia:index -> #ib:index ->\n           m ia a -> \n           (a -> m ib b) ->\n           m (op ia ib) b\n\n}\n\n\nWith this class, we have overloaded ( let+ ) to work with all\ngraded monads. For instance, hereâ€™s a graded state monad, count_st whose index counts the number of put operations.\n\nlet count_st (s:Type) (count:nat) (a:Type) = s -> a & s & z:nat{z==count}\n\nlet count_return (#s:Type) (#a:Type) (x:a) : count_st s one a = fun s -> x, s, one #nat\n\nlet count_bind (#s:Type) (#a:Type) (#b:Type) (#ia:nat) (#ib:nat)\n               (f:count_st s ia a)\n               (g:(a -> count_st s ib b))\n  : count_st s (op ia ib) b\n  = fun s -> let x, s, n = f s in\n          let y, s', m = g x s in\n          y, s', op #nat n m\n\ninstance count_st_graded (s:Type) : graded_monad (count_st s) =\n{ \n  return = count_return #s;\n  ( let+ ) = count_bind #s;\n}\n\n// A write-counting grade monad\nlet get #s : count_st s 0 s = fun s -> s, s, 0\nlet put #s (x:s) : count_st s 1 unit = fun _ -> (), x, 1\n\n\nWe can build computations in our graded count_st monad relatively\neasily.\n\nlet test #s =\n  let+ x = get #s in\n  put x\n\n//F* + SMT automatically proves that the index simplifies to 2\nlet test2 #s : count_st s 2 unit =\n  let+ x = get in\n  put x ;+\n  put x\n\n\nF* infers the typeclass instantiations and the type of test to be count_st s (op #monoid_nat_plus 0 1) unit .\n\nIn test2 , F* infers the type count_st s (op #monoid_nat_plus 0 (op #monoid_nat_plus 1 1)) unit , and then automatically proves that\nthis type is equivalent to the user annotation count_st s 2 unit ,\nusing the definition of monoid_nat_plus . Note, when one defines let+ , one can also use e1 ;+ e2 to sequence computations when\nthe result type of e1 is unit .\n\nTypeclasses are a flexible way to structure programs in an abstract\nand generic style. Not only can this make program construction more\nmodular, it can also make proofs and reasoning more abstract,\nparticularly when typeclasses contain not just methods but also\nproperties characterizing how those methods ought to behave. Reasoning\nabstractly can make proofs simpler: for example, if the monoid-ness of\nnatural number addition is the only property needed for a proof, it\nmay be simpler to do a proof generically for all monoids, rather than\nreasoning specifically about integer arithmetic.\n\nThat latter part of this chapter presented typeclasses for\ncomputational structures like monads and functors. Perhaps conspicuous\nin these examples were the lack of algebraic laws that characterize\nthese structures. Indeed, we focused primarily on programming with\nmonads and graded monads, rather than reasoning about them. Enhancing\nthese typeclasses with algebraic laws is a useful, if\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MONOID<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A typeclass for an algebraic structure with a single associative binary operation and a unit element)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GRADED MONAD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A type constructor indexed by a monoid to characterize properties of monadic computation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MONOID_NAT_PLUS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An instance of monoid representing natural numbers with addition)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COUNT_ST<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A graded state monad whose index counts the number of put operations)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHIN-YA KATSUMATA<|>PERSON<|>Researcher who studied graded monads)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

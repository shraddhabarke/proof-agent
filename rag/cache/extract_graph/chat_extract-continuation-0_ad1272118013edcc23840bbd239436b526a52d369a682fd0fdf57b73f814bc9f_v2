Identify all entities.

From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n \n3.

The main part is the quantified trade in the invariant, which, as\nwe traverse the list, encapsulates the ghost code that we need to\nrun at the end to restore permission to the initial list pointer x .\n\n- The library function, FA.trans_compose has the following\nsignature: ghost fn trans_compose (#a #b #c:Type0)\n                 (p: a -> vprop)\n                 (q: b -> vprop)\n                 (r: c -> vprop)\n                 (f: a -> GTot b)\n                 (g: b -> GTot c) requires ( forall * x. p x @==> q (f x)) **\n  ( forall * x. q x @==> r (g x)) ensures forall * x. p x @==> r (g (f x)) We use it in the key induction step as we move one step down the\nlist—similar to what we had in length_iter , but this time\nwith a quantifier.\n\nghost\nfn trans_compose (#a #b #c:Type0)\n                 (p: a -> vprop)\n                 (q: b -> vprop)\n                 (r: c -> vprop)\n                 (f: a -> GTot b)\n                 (g: b -> GTot c)\nrequires\n  (forall* x. p x @==> q (f x)) **\n  (forall* x. q x @==> r (g x))\nensures\n  forall* x. p x @==> r (g (f x))\n\n\n- Illustrating again that Pulse is a superset of pure F*, we make\nuse of a bit of F* sugar in the introduce forall to prove a property needed for a Pulse\nrewrite.\n\n- Finally, at the end of the loop, we use FA.elim_forall_imp to\nrestore permission on x , now pointing to a concatenated list,\neffectively running all the ghost code we accumulated as we\ntraversed the list.\n\nPerhaps the lesson from all this is that recursive programs are much\neasier to write and prove correct that iterative ones? That’s one\ntakeaway. But, hopefully, you’ve seen how trades and quantifiers work\nand can be useful in some proofs—of course, we’ll use them not just\nfor rewriting recursive as iterative code.\n\nWrite a function to insert an element in a list and a specific\nposition.\n\nWrite a function to reverse a list.\n\n© Copyright 2020, Microsoft Research.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>FA.TRANS_COMPOSE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A library function with a specific signature used in programming for composing transitions between states)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PULSE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A superset of pure F*, illustrating the use of programming constructs for proving properties)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MICROSOFT RESEARCH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An organization that holds copyright for the document, likely involved in computer science and programming research)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FA.TRANS_COMPOSE<|>PULSE<|>FA.trans_compose is used within the context of Pulse to illustrate programming concepts<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PULSE<|>MICROSOFT RESEARCH<|>Pulse, as a programming concept, is documented or researched by Microsoft Research<|>4)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

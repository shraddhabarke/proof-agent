So, you\nneedn't write it.\n\nOn the other hand, it you were to flip the order of arguments to\n``ackermann``, then the default choice of the measure would not be\ncorrect—so, you'll have to write it explicitly, as shown below.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Part1.Termination.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: SNIPPET_START: ackermann_flip\n   :end-before: SNIPPET_END: ackermann_flip\n\n.. _Part1_mutual_recursion:\n\nMutual recursion\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nF* also supports mutual recursion and the same check of proving that a\nmeasure of the arguments decreases on each (mutually) recursive call\napplies.\n\nFor example, one can write the following code to define a binary\n``tree`` that stores an integer at each internal node—the keyword\n``and`` allows defining several types that depend mutually on each\nother.\n\nTo increment all the integers in the tree, we can write the mutually\nrecursive functions, again using ``and`` to define ``incr_tree`` and\n``incr_node`` to depend mutually on each other. F* is able to prove\nthat these functions terminate, just by using the default measure as\nusual.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Part1.Termination.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: incr_tree\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: incr_tree\n\n.. note::\n\n   Sometimes, a little trick with lexicographic orderings can help\n   prove mutually recursive functions correct. We include it here as a\n   tip, you can probably skip it on a first read.\n\n   .. literalinclude:: ../code/Part1.Termination.fst\n      :language: fstar\n      :start-after: SNIPPET_START: foo_bar\n      :end-before: SNIPPET_END: foo_bar\n\n   What's happening here is that when ``foo l`` calls ``bar``, the\n   argument ``xs`` is legitimately a sub-term of ``l``. However, ``bar\n   l`` simply calls back ``foo l``, without decreasing the\n   argument. The reason this terminates, however, is that ``bar`` can\n   freely call back ``foo``, since ``foo`` will only ever call ``bar``\n   again with a smaller argument. You can convince F* of this by\n   writing the decreases clauses shown, i.e., when ``bar`` calls\n   ``foo``, ``l`` doesn't change, but the second component of the\n   lexicographic ordering does decrease, i.e., ``0 << 1``.\n\n\nThe termination check, precisely\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nHaving seen a few examples at work, we can now describe how the\ntermination check works in general.\n\n\n.. note::\n\n   We use a slightly more mathematical notation here, so that we can\n   be precise.

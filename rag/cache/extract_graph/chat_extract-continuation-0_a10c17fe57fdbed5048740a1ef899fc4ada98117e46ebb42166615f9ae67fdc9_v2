In this first chapter, we\nbriefly touch upon two different kinds of equality in F*, providing\nsome basic information sufficient for the simplest usages. In a subsequent chapter , we’ll cover equality in\nmuch greater depth.\n\nWe’ve implicitly used the equality operator = already (e.g., when\ndefining factorial ). This is the boolean equality\noperator. Given two terms e₁ : t and e₂ : t , so long as t supports a notion of decidable equality, (e₁ = e₂) : bool .\n\nTo see why not all types support decidably equality, consider t to\nbe a function type, like int -> int . To decide if two functions f₁, f₂ : int -> int are equal, we’d have to apply them to all the\ninfinitely many integers and compare their results—clearly, this is\nnot decidable.\n\nThe type eqtype is the type of types that support decidably\nequality. That is, given e₁ : t and e₂ : t , it is only\npermissible to compare e₁ = e₂ if t : eqtype .\n\nFor any type definition, F* automatically computes whether or not that\ntype is an eqtype . We’ll explain later exactly how F* decides\nwhether or not a type is an eqtype . Roughly, for F* has built-in\nknowledge that various primitive types like integers and booleans\nsupport decidable equality. When defining a new type, F* checks\nthat all values of the new type are composed structurally of terms\nthat support decidable equality. In particular, if an e : t may\ncontain a sub-term that is a function, then t cannot be an eqtype .\n\nAs such, the type of the decidable equality operator is\n\nval ( = ) (#a:eqtype) (x:a) (y:a) : bool\n\n\nThat is, x = y is well-typed only when x : a and y : a and a : eqtype .\n\nNote\n\nWe see here a bit of F* syntax for defining infix operators. Rather\nthan only using the val or let notation with alphanumeric\nidentifiers, the notation ( = ) introduces an infix operator\ndefined with non-alphanumeric symbols. You can read more about this here .\n\nF* offers another notion of equality, propositional equality, written == . For any type t , given terms e₁, e₂ : t , the\nproposition e₁ == e₂ asserts the (possibly undecidable) equality\nof e₁ and e₂ . The type of the propositional equality operator\nis shown below:\n\nval ( == ) (#a:Type) (x:a) (y:a) : prop\n\n\nUnlike decidable equality (=) , propositional equality is defined\nfor all types. The result type of (==) is prop , the type of\npropositions. We’ll learn more about that in the next chapter .\n\n© Copyright 2020, Microsoft Research.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>F*<|>ORGANIZATION<|>F* is a programming language that deals with dependent type theories and includes features for deciding equality among types)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EQUALITY<|>EVENT<|>Equality in F* refers to the concept and implementation of two kinds of equality: boolean equality and propositional equality)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EQTYPE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Eqtype is a type in F* that supports decidable equality, meaning it can be used to compare two terms of the same type for equality)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MICROSOFT RESEARCH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Microsoft Research is the entity that holds the copyright for the document discussing equality in F*)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EQUALITY<|>F*<|>Equality is a fundamental concept in F* that is explored in depth within its type system<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EQTYPE<|>F*<|>Eqtype is a specific type within F* that determines if types support decidable equality<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MICROSOFT RESEARCH<|>F*<|>Microsoft Research is associated with F* through copyright of the document discussing its type theories<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

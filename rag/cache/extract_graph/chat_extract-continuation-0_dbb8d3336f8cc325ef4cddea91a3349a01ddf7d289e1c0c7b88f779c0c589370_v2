Otherwise, the last component of the tuple decreases\n    (since ``e1`` and ``e2`` are proper sub-terms of ``e``), while\n    none of the other components of the tuple change.\n\n  - The call to ``sub_elam s`` in ``ELam`` terminates because the\n    third component of the tuple decreases from ``1`` to ``0``, while\n    the first two do not change.\n\n  - The final recursive call to ``subst`` terminates for similar\n    reasons to the recursive calls in the ``EApp`` case, since the\n    type of ``sub_elam`` guarantees that ``sub_elam s`` is renaming if\n    an only of ``s`` is (so the ``r`` bit does not change).\n\n* Cases of ``sub_elam``, in the recursive call to ``subst sub_inc (s\n  (y - 1))``, we have already proven that ``sub_inc`` is a\n  renaming. So, we have two cases to consider:\n\n  - If ``s (y - 1)`` is a variable, then ``bool_order (EVar? e)``, the\n    first component of the decreases clause of ``subst`` is ``0``,\n    which clearly precedes ``1``, the first component of the decreases\n    clause of ``subst_elam``.\n\n  - Otherwwise, ``s (y - 1)`` is not a variable, so ``s`` is\n    definitely not a renaming while ``sub_inc`` is. So, the second\n    second component of the decreases clause decreases while the first\n    component is unchanged.\n\nFinally, we need to prove that ``sub_elam s`` is a renaming if and\nonly if ``s`` is. For this, we need two things:\n\n* First, strengthen the type of ``subst s`` to show that it maps\n  variables to variables if and only if ``r`` is a renaming,\n\n* Second, we need to instantiate an exisential quantifier in\n  ``sub_elam``, to show that if ``s`` is not a renaming, then it must\n  map some ``x`` to a non-variable and, hence, ``sub_elam s (x + 1)``\n  is a non-variable too. One way to do this is by asserting this fact,\n  which is a sufficient hint to the SMT solver to find the\n  instantiation needed. Another way is to explicitly introduce the\n  existential, as in the exercise below.\n\nIn summary, using indexed types combined with well-founded recursion\non lexicographic orderings, we were able to prove our definitions\ntotal. That said, coming up with such orderings is non-trivial and\nrequires some ingenuity, but once you do, it allows for relatively\ncompact definitions that handle both substiutions and renamings.\n\nExercise\n^^^^^^^^\n\nRemove the first component of the decreases clause of both definitions\nand revise the definitions to make F* accept it.\n\nYour solution should have signature\n\n.. code-block:: fstar\n\n   let rec subst1 (#r:bool)\n                  (s:sub r)\n                  (e:exp)\n     : Tot (e':exp { r ==> (EVar? e <==> EVar? e') })\n           (decreases %[bool_order r;\n                        1;\n                        e])\n   ...\n\n   and sub_elam1 (#r:bool) (s:sub r)\n     : Tot (sub r)\n           (decreases %[bool_order r;\n                        0;\n                        EVar 0])\n\n\n.. container:: toggle\n\n    .. container:: header\n\n       **Hint**\n\n    Inline a case of ``subst`` in ``subst_elam``.\n    The answer is included with the next problem below.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nReplace the assertion in ``subst_elam`` with a proof that explicitly\nintroduces the existential quantifier.\n\n.. container:: toggle\n\n    .. container:: header\n\n       **Answer**\n\n    .. literalinclude:: ../code/Part2.STLC.fst\n       :language: fstar\n       :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: subst1$\n       :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: subst1$\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nType system\n+++++++++++\n\nIf when running a program, if one ends up with an term like\n:math:`()~e` (i.e., some non-function term like :\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

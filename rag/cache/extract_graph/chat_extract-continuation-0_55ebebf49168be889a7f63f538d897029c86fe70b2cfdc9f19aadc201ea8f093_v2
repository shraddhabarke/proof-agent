However, upon reviewing the provided text again, it appears that the text primarily consists of mathematical and programming concepts related to lemmas, assertions, and operations within a computational or mathematical context, rather than entities that can be classified into the specified types of organization, person, geo, or event. The text seems to be a snippet from a programming or mathematical document, likely discussing algorithms or proofs in the context of computer science or mathematics, specifically focusing on bitwise operations and lemmas in a formal verification or theorem proving context.\n\nGiven the nature of the text and the specified entity types (organization, person, geo, event), it does not contain information that directly corresponds to these categories. The entities extracted in the previous response were incorrectly identified due to a misunderstanding of the task requirements in relation to the content of the text. The text does not mention organizations, persons, geographical locations, or events in the context that matches the task's entity types.\n\nTherefore, based on the correct understanding of the task and the content of the provided text, there are no entities to extract that fit the specified types.

With a single\nclick, you can get a full-fledged IDE (VS Code) running in your browser\nalready configured with F* and Pulse.\n\nYou can also run Pulse inside a container locally, for a similar 1-click setup\nthat is independent of Github.\n\nFinally, you can also extract a Pulse release tarball and run\nthe binaries directly in your system.\n\n(Building from source is not well-documented yet.)\n\nNote\n\nUnlike the pure F* parts of this tutorial, Pulse code does not yet\nwork in the online playground. Use one of the methods described\nbelow to try the examples in this part of the book.\n\nYou can find all the source files associated with each chapter in\nthis folder ,\nin files named PulseTutorial.*.fst .\n\nTo do so, go to the this\nrepository and click on the\n‘<>Code’ button, then select ‘Create codespace on main’. This will use\nthe Dev Container definition in the .devcontainer directory to set up\ncontainer where F* and Pulse can run in a reproducible manner.\n\nYou should be greeted, after a minute or two, by a VS Code instance\nrunning in your browser displaying this same README.\n\nAll the usual F* navigation commands should work on Pulse files.\n\nIf you prefer a local UI instead of a browser tab, you can “open”\nthe Codespace from your local VS Code installation like so:\n\nF* and Pulse are still running on Github’s servers, so the usage is\nstill computed, but you may find the UI more comfortable.\n\nThe Dev Container configuration contains all that is needed to run\nPulse in an isolated, reproducible manner. If you would like to avoid\nCodespaces and just run locally, VS Code can set up the Dev Container\nlocally for you very easily.\n\nSimply open the repository in VS Code. You should see a popup claiming\nthat the project has a Dev Container. Choose ‘Reopen in Dev Container’\nto trigger a build of the container. VS Code will spawn a new window to\ndownload the base Docker image, set up the extension in it, and open the\nrepository again.\n\nThis new window should now work as usual.\n\nA release of Pulse, including related F* tools, is available here . Uncompress\nthe archive and add follow the instructions in the README.md, notably\nsetting the recommended environment variables.\n\nWe also recommend installing VS Code and the fstar-vscode-assistant,\nfrom the VS Code marketplace. This should pick up the F* and Pulse\ninstallation from your path.\n\n© Copyright 2020, Microsoft Research.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>GITHUB CODESPACES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A platform provided by Github that allows for a 1-click setup of a full-fledged IDE running in the browser, configured with F* and Pulse)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PULSE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A software tool that can be run in various environments, including Github Codespaces, locally inside a container, or by running binaries directly on a system)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VS CODE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that can run in the browser via Github Codespaces, configured for use with F* and Pulse)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>F*<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A programming language that, along with Pulse, is configured to work in the Github Codespaces environment)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MICROSOFT RESEARCH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The copyright holder of the document, likely involved in the development or sponsorship of Pulse and its documentation)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GITHUB CODESPACES<|>PULSE<|>Github Codespaces provides an environment for running Pulse with a single click<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GITHUB CODESPACES<|>VS CODE<|>Github Codespaces runs VS Code in the browser as its IDE<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PULSE<|>VS CODE<|>Pulse is configured to work within VS Code, especially when set up through Github Codespaces<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PULSE<|>F*<|>Pulse is mentioned alongside F* as being part of the setup in Github Codespaces<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MICROSOFT RESEARCH<|>PULSE<|>Microsoft Research is the copyright holder of the document, indicating a relationship with the development or sponsorship of Pulse<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

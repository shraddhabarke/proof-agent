That is, pure terms can be\nreasoned about like pure mathematical functions. [#]_\n\nHowever, many practical programs exhibit behaviors that are beyond\njust their output. For example, they may mutate some global state, or\nthey may read and write files, or receive or send messages over the\nnetwork---such behaviors are often called *side effects*,\n*computational effects*, or just *effects*.\n\nIn this section, we look at F*'s effect system which allows users to\n\n  * Model the semantics of various kinds of effects, e.g., mutable\n    state, input/output, concurrency, etc.\n\n  * Develop reasoning principles that enable building proofs of\n    various properties of effectful programs\n\n  * Simplify effectful program construction by encapsulating the\n    semantic model and reasoning principles within an abstraction that\n    allows users to write programs in F*'s native syntax while behind\n    the scenes, for reasoning and execution purposes, programs are\n    elaborated into the semantic model\n\nAside from user-defined effects, F*'s also supports the following\n*primitive* effects:\n\n  * **Ghost**: An effect which describes which parts of a program have\n    no observable behavior at all, and do not even influence the\n    result returned by the program. This allows optimizing a program\n    by erasing the parts of a program that are computationally\n    irrelevant.\n\n  * **Divergence**: An effect that encapsulates computations which may\n    run forever. Potentially divergent computations cannot be used as\n    proofs (see :ref:`termination<Part1_termination>`) and the effect\n    system ensures that this is so.\n\n  * **Partiality**: Partial functions are only defined over a subset\n    of their domain. F* provides primitive support for partial\n    functions as an effect. Although currently primitive, in the\n    future, we hope to remove the special status of partial functions\n    and make partial functions a user-defined notion too.\n\n  \n.. [#] Although pure F* programs are mathematical functions\n       in the ideal sense, when executing these programs on a\n       computer, they do exhibit various side effects, including\n       consuming resources like time, power, and memory. Although\n       these side effects are clearly observable to an external\n       observer of a running F* program, the resourse-usage side\n       effects of one component of a pure F* program are not visible\n       to another component of the same program.\n\n.. toctree::\n   :maxdepth: 1\n   :caption: Contents:\n\n   part4_background\n   part4_computation_types_and_tot\n   part4_ghost\n   part4_div\n   part4_pure\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>F*<|>ORGANIZATION<|>F* is a programming language that models the semantics of various kinds of effects, such as mutable state, input/output, and concurrency, and supports building proofs of properties of effectful programs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GHOST<|>EVENT<|>Ghost is an effect in F* that describes parts of a program with no observable behavior, allowing for optimization by erasing computationally irrelevant parts)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DIVERGENCE<|>EVENT<|>Divergence is an effect in F* that encapsulates computations which may run indefinitely, ensuring such computations cannot be used as proofs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PARTIALITY<|>EVENT<|>Partiality represents partial functions in F*, defined only over a subset of their domain, with support for these functions as an effect)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

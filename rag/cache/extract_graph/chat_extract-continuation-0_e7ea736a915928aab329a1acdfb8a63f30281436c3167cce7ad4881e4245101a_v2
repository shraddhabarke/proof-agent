For example,\nwhy is it safe to call ``L.hd`` to access the first element of\n``hashes``?\n\n\nCorrectness\n...........\n\nNow, we can prove our main correctness theorem, namely that\n``get_with_evidence`` returns a resource with verifiable\nevidence.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/MerkleTree.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: correctness\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: correctness\n\nThe proof is a simple proof by induction on the height of the tree, or\nequivalently, the length of the resource id.\n\nIn other words, evidence constructed by a honest prover is accepted by\nour verifier.\n\nSecurity\n........\n\nThe main security theorem associated with this construction is the\nfollowing: if the verifier can be convinced to accept a resource with\nevidence of the form ``RES r rid hs``, and if the resource in the\nMerkle tree associated with ``rid`` is *not* ``r``, then we can easily\nconstruct a collision on the underlying cryptographic hash. Since the\nhash is meant to be collision resistant, one should conclude that it\nis at least as hard to convince our verifier to accept incorrect\nevidence as it is to find collisions on the underlying hash.\n\nWe start by defining the type of a ``hash_collision``, a pair of\ndistinct strings that hash to the same value.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/MerkleTree.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: hash_collision\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: hash_collision\n\nThe ``security`` theorem shown below takes a ``tree`` and\n``p:resource_with_evidence n``, where the refinement on ``p`` states\nthat the verifier accepts the evidence (``verify p tree``) although\nthe resource associated with ``p.ri`` is not ``p.res``: in this case,\nwe can build a function, by induction on the height of the tree, that\nreturns a hash collision.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/MerkleTree.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: security\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: security\n\nWe look at its cases in detail:\n\n   * In the base case, it's easy to construct a hash collision\n     directly from the differing resources.\n\n   * Otherwise, we recompute the hash associate with the current node\n     from the tail of the evidence presented, and the two cases of the\n     left and right subtrees are symmetric.\n\n     - If the recomputed hash matches the hash of the node, then we\n       can generate a collision just by the induction hypothesis on\n       the left or right subtree.\n\n     - Otherwise, we can build a hash collision, relying on\n       ``String.concat_injective``, a lemma from the library stating\n       that the concatenation of two pairs of equal length strings are\n       equal only if their components are. Knowing that ``h' <> h1``\n       (or, symmetically, ``h' <> h2``) this allows us to prove that\n       the concatenations are unequal, although their hashes are, by\n       assumption, equal.\n\n.. _Part2_merkle_insert:\n\nExercise\n........\n\nImplement a function to update an ``mtree`` at a given\n``rid:resource_id`` with a new resource ``res:resource``. The\nresulting tree will have a new root hash, so you will have to return\nthe new hash along with the updated tree.\n\n`Exercise file <../code/exercises/Part2.MerkleTreeUpdate_V0.fst>`__\n\n.. container:: toggle\n\n    .. container:: header\n\n       **Hint**\n\n    One type of the ``update`` function could be as follows:\n\n    .. literalinclude:: ../code/MerkleTree.fst\n       :language: fstar\n       :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: update_hint\n       :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: update_hint\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n.. container:: toggle\n\n    .. container:: header\n\n       **Answer**\n\n    .. literalinclude:: ../code/MerkleTree.fst\n       :language: fstar\n       :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: update_mtree'\n       :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: update_mtree'\n\n    One interesting part of our solution is that we never explicitly\n    construct the hash of the nodes.

Besides, in many safety critical software\nsystems, one often prefers to avoid integer overflow altogether.\n\nSo, the UInt32 interface also provides two additional operations, add and sub , whose specification enables two t values to be added\n(resp. subtracted) only if there is no overflow (or underflow).\n\nFirst, we define an auxiliary predicate fits to state when an\noperation does not overflow or underflow.\n\nlet fits (op: int -> int -> int)\n         (x y : t)\n  = min <= op (v x) (v y) /\\\n    op (v x) (v y) <= max\n\n\nThen, we use fits to restrict the domain of add and sub and the type ensures that the result is the sum (resp. difference) of\nthe arguments, without need for any modular arithmetic.\n\n(** Bounds-respecting addition\n\n    The precondition enforces that the sum does not overflow,\n    expressing the bound as an addition on mathematical integers *)\nval add (a:t) (b:t { fits (+) a b }) \n  : y:t{ v y == v a + v b }\n\n\n(** Bounds-respecting subtraction\n\n    The precondition enforces that the difference does not underflow,\n    expressing the bound as an subtraction on mathematical integers *)\nval sub (a:t) (b:t { fits (fun x y -> x - y) a b }) \n  : y:t{ v y == v a - v b }\n\n\nNote\n\nAlthough the addition operator can be used as a first-class\nfunction with the notation (+) , the same does not work for\nsubtraction, since (-) resolves to unary integer negation,\nrather than subtraction—so, we write fun x y -> x - y .\n\nFinally, the interface also provides a comparison operator lt , as\nspecified below:\n\n(** Less than *)\nval lt (a:t) (b:t) \n  : r:bool { r <==> v a < v b }\n\n\nAn implementation of UInt32 must provide definitions for\nall the val declarations in the UInt32 interface, starting\nwith a representation for the abstract type t .\n\nThere are multiple possible representations for t , however the\npoint of the interface is to isolate client modules from these\nimplementation choices.\n\nPerhaps the easiest implementation is to represent t as a u32_nat itself. This makes proving the correspondence between t and its logical model almost trivial.\n\nmodule UInt32\n\nlet t = n:nat { n <= pow2 32 - 1}\n\nlet v (x:t) = x\nlet u (x:u32_nat) = x\n\nlet uv_inv x = ()\nlet vu_inv x = ()\n\nlet add_mod a b = (a + b) % pow2 32\nlet sub_mod a b = (a - b) % pow2 32\n\nlet add a b = a + b\nlet sub a b = a - b\n\nlet lt (a:t) (b:t) = v a < v b\n\n\nAnother choice may be to represent t as a 32-bit vector. This is a\nbit harder and proving that it is correct with respect to the\ninterface requires handling some interactions between Z3’s theory of\nbit vectors and uninterpreted functions, which we handle with a\ntactic.

Instead, it discusses functions, sorts, and concepts related to SMT (Satisfiability Modulo Theories) encoding in the F* programming language.

The :weight annotation is an SMT2 detail: setting it to zero ensures\nthat the SMT solver can instantiate this quantifier as often as\nneeded, so long as the the fuel instrumentation argument is non-zero.\nNotice that the equation peels off one application of SFuel , so\nthat the quantifier cannot be repeatedly instantiated infinitely.\n\n(assert (!

The value of this\nconstant is determined by the F* options --initial_fuel n and --max_fuel m .

Additionally, the option --fuel n sets both the initial\nfuel and max fuel to n .\n\nThis single value of MaxFuel controls the number of unfoldings of all recursive functions in scope. Of course, the patterns are\narranged so that if you have a query involving, say, List.map ,\nquantified assumptions about an unrelated recursive function like factorial should never trigger. Neverthless, large values of MaxFuel greatly increase the search space for the SMT solver.

If the lemma has a precondition, it is\npresented as a separate goal.\n\nSee the FStar.Tactics.Logic module for more.\n\nWe have previously seen compute() , which blasts a goal with F*’s\nnormalizer to reduce it into a normal form . We sometimes need a\nbit more control than that, and hence there are several tactics to\nnormalize goals in different ways. Most of them are implemented via a\nfew configurable primitives (you can look up their definitions in the\nstandard library)\n\n- compute() : calls the normalizer with almost all steps enabled\n\n- simpl() : simplifies logical operations (e.g. reduces p /\\ True to p ).\n\n- whnf() (short for “weak head normal form”): reduces the goal\nuntil its “head” is evident.\n\n- unfold_def `t : unfolds the definition of the name t in the goal,\nfully normalizing its body.\n\n- trivial() : if the goal is trivial after normalization and simplification,\nsolve it.\n\nThe norm primitive provides fine-grained control. Its type is list norm_step -> Tac unit . The full list of norm_step s can\nbe found in the FStar.Pervasives module, and it is the same one\navailable for the norm marker in Pervasives (beware of the\nname clash between Tactics.norm and Pervasives.norm !).\n\nAs part of automating proofs, we often need to inspect the syntax of\nthe goal and the hypotheses in the context to decide what to do. For\ninstance, instead of blindly trying to apply the split tactic (and\nrecovering if it fails), we could instead look at the shape of the\ngoal and apply split only if the goal has the shape p1 /\\ p2 .\n\nNote: inspecting syntax is, perhaps obviously, not something we can\njust do everywhere. If a function was allowed to inspect the syntax of\nits argument, it could behave differently on 1+2 and 3 , which\nis bad, since 1+2 == 3 in F*, and functions are expected to map\nequal arguments to the same result. So, for the most part, we cannot\nsimply turn a value of type a into its syntax. Hence, quotations\nare static , they simply represent the syntax of a term and one\ncannot turn values into terms.  There is a more powerful mechanism of dynamic quotations that will be explained later, but suffice it to\nsay for now that this can only be done in the Tac effect.\n\nAs an example, the cur_goal() tactic will return a value of type typ (an alias for term indicating that the term is really the\nrepresentation of an F* type) representing the syntax of the current\ngoal.\n\nThe term type is abstract : it has no observable structure\nitself. Think of it as an opaque “box” containing a term inside. A\npriori, all that can be done with a term is pass it to primitives\nthat expect one, such as tc to type-check it or norm_term to\nnormalize it. But none of those give us full, programatic access to\nthe structure of the term.\n\nThat’s where the term_view comes in: following a classic idea\nintroduced by Phil Wadler , there is function\ncalled inspect that turns a term into a term_view . The term_view type resembles an AST, but crucially it is not\nrecursive: its subterms have type term rather than term_view .\n\n noeq\n type term_view =\n   | Tv_FVar   : v:fv -> term_view\n   | Tv_App    : hd:term -> a:argv -> term_view\n   | Tv_Abs    : bv:binder -> body:term -> term_view\n   | Tv_Arrow  : bv:binder -> c:comp -> term_view\n   ...\n\n\nThe inspect primitves “peels away” one level of the abstraction\nlayer, giving access to the top-level shape of the term.\n\nThe Tv_FVar node above represents (an ocurrence of) a global name.\nThe fv type is also abstract, and can be viewed as a name (which\nis just list string ) via inspect_fv .\n\nFor instance, if we were to inspect `qr_s (which we used above)\nwe would obtain a Tv_FVar v , where inspect_fv v is something\nlike [\"Path\"; \"To\"; \"Module\"; \"qr_s\"] , that is, an “exploded”\nrepresentation of the fully-qualified name Path.To.Module.qr-s .\n\nEvery syntactic construct (terms, free variables, bound variables,\nbinders, computation types, etc) is modeled abstractly like term and fv , and has a corresponding inspection functions. A list can be found\nin FStar.Reflection.Builtins .\n\nIf the inspected term is an application, inspect will return a Tv_App f a node. Here f is a term , so if we want to know its\nstructure we must recursively call inspect on it. The a part\nis an argument , consisting of a term and an argument qualifier\n( aqualv ). The qualifier specifies if the application is implicit or\nexplicit.\n\nOf course, in the case of a nested application such as f x y , this\nis nested as (f x) y\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>FORALL_INTRO<|>EVENT<|>A tactic for introducing a fresh variable into the context and presenting a goal for a predicate\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>L_INTROS<|>EVENT<|>A tactic to introduce implications and foralls as much as possible\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPLIT<|>EVENT<|>A tactic to split a conjunction into two separate goals\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LEFT<|>EVENT<|>A tactic to prove a disjunction by proving the left side\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RIGHT<|>EVENT<|>A tactic to prove a disjunction by proving the right side\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ASSUMPTION<|>EVENT<|>A tactic to prove the goal using a hypothesis in the context\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>POSE_LEMMA<|>EVENT<|>A tactic to add a lemma's postcondition to the context, presenting its precondition as a separate goal if any\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COMPUTE<|>EVENT<|>A tactic that calls the normalizer with almost all steps enabled to reduce a goal to its normal form\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SIMPL<|>EVENT<|>A tactic that simplifies logical operations, such as reducing p /\\ True to p\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WHNF<|>EVENT<|>A tactic that reduces the goal until its 'head' is evident, known as 'weak head normal form'\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNFOLD_DEF<|>EVENT<|>A tactic to unfold the definition of a name in the goal, fully normalizing its body\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TRIVIAL<|>EVENT<|>A tactic that solves the goal if it is trivial after normalization and simplification\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NORM<|>EVENT<|>A tactic providing fine-grained control over normalization with a list of norm steps\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FSTAR.TACTICS.LOGIC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A module in F* that includes various logical tactics for automating proofs\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FSTAR.PERVASIVES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A module in F* that includes the full list of norm steps and other basic operations\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FSTAR.REFLECTION.BUILTINS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A module in F* that includes inspection functions for syntactic constructs\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COMPUTE<|>FSTAR.TACTICS.LOGIC<|>The compute tactic is discussed within the context of the FStar.Tactics.Logic module<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NORM<|>FSTAR.PERVASIVES<|>The norm tactic uses the list of norm steps available in the FStar.Pervasives module<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>UNFOLD_DEF<|>FSTAR.REFLECTION.BUILTINS<|>The unfold_def tactic's functionality is related to the inspection functions found in FStar.Reflection.Builtins<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

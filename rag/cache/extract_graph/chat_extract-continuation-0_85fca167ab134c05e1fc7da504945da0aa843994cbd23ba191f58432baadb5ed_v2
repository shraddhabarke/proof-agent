We'll subvert the universe system by treating ``set`` as\nliving in universe ``u#0``, even though its constructor ``Set`` has a\nfield ``x:Type u#0`` that has universe level ``u#1``\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Russell.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: set$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: set$\n\nThis construction allows us to define many useful sets. For example,\nthe empty set ``zero`` uses the empty type ``False`` as the domain of\nits comprehension and so has no elements; or the singleton set ``one``\nwhose only element is the empty set; or the set ``two`` that contains\nthe empty set ``zero`` and the singleton set ``one``.\n                \n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Russell.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: zero,one,two$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: zero,one,two$\n\nOne can also define set membership: A set ``a`` is a member of a set\n``b``, if one can exhibit an element ``v`` of the domain type of\n``b`` (i.e., ``(project b).x``), such that ``b``'s comprehension\n``(project b).f`` applied to ``v`` is ``a``.\n\nFor example, one can prove ``mem zero two`` by picking ``true`` for\n``v`` and ``mem one two`` by picking ``false`` for\n``v``. Non-membership is just the negation of membership.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Russell.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: mem$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: mem$\n\nNow, we are ready to define Russell's paradoxical set\n:math:`\\Delta`. First, we define ``delta_big`` in a larger universe\nand then use ``inject`` to turn it into a ``set : Type u#0``. The\nencoding of ``delta_big`` is fairly direct: Its domain type is the\ntype of sets ``s`` paired with a proof that ``s`` does not contain\nitself; and its comprehension function just returns ``s`` itself.\n      \n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Russell.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: delta$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: delta$\n\nWe can now prove both ``delta `mem` delta`` and ``delta `not_mem`\ndelta``, using the unsound ``inj_proj`` axiom that breaks the universe\nsystem, and derive ``False``.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Russell.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: proof$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: proof$\n\nThe proofs are more detailed than they need to be, and if you're\ncurious, maybe you can follow along by reading the comments.\n\nThe upshot, however, is that without the stratification of universes,\nF* would be unsound.\n\n\nRefinement types, FStar.Squash, ``prop``, and Impredicativity\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe've seen how universes levels are computed for arrow types and\ninductive type definitions. The other way in which types can be formed\nin F* is with refinement types: ``x:t{p}``. As we've seen previously,\na value ``v`` of type ``x:t{p}`` is just a ``v:t`` where ``p[v/x]`` is\nderivable in the current scope in F*'s SMT-assisted classical\nlogic—there is no way to extract a proof of ``p`` from a proof of\n``x:t{p}``, i.e., refinement types are F*'s mechanism for proof\nirrelevance.\n\n**Universe of a refinement type**: The universe of a refinement type ``x:t{p}`` is the universe of ``t``.\n\nSince the universe of a refinement type does not depend on ``p``, it\nenables a limited form of impredicativity, and we can define the\nfollowing type (summarized here from the F* standard library\n``FStar.Squash``):\n\n.. code-block:: fstar\n\n   let squash (p:Type u#p) : Type u#0 = _:unit { p }\n   let return_squash (p:Type u#p) (x:p) : squash p = ()\n\nThis is a lot like the ``lower`` and ``inject`` assumptions that we\nsaw in the previous section, but, importantly, there is no ``project``\noperation to invert an ``inject``. In fact, ``FStar.Squash`` proves\nthat ``squash p`` is proof irrelevant, meaning that all proofs of\n``squash p`` are equal.\n\n.. code-block:: fstar\n\n   val proof_irrelevance (p: Type u#p) (x y: squash p) : squash (x == y)\n\n``FStar.Squash`` does provide a limited way to manipulate a proof of\n``p`` given a ``squash p``, using the combinator ``bind_squash`` shown\nbelow, which states that if ``f`` can build a proof ``\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SET<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A concept in mathematics and computer science where members are collected into a whole; a set comprehension defines a set in terms of a predicate over its elements.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FSTAR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A programming language designed for program verification, supporting features like refinement types and a universe system to ensure soundness.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ZERO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A set defined in F* representing the empty set, having no elements.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ONE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A set defined in F* representing a singleton set, whose only element is the empty set.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TWO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A set defined in F* that contains the empty set and the singleton set as its elements.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DELTA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A set defined in F* that leads to Russell's paradox, showing a set can both contain and not contain itself under certain conditions.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ZERO<|>SET<|>Zero is a specific instance of a set with no elements.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ONE<|>SET<|>One is a specific instance of a set with exactly one element, the empty set.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TWO<|>SET<|>Two is a specific instance of a set containing the empty set and the singleton set.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DELTA<|>SET<|>Delta is a set that demonstrates Russell's paradox within the context of set theory in F*.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FSTAR<|>SET<|>F* is the programming language used to define and manipulate sets like zero, one, two, and delta.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FSTAR<|>ZERO<|>F* defines the concept of the empty set, zero.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FSTAR<|>ONE<|>F* defines the concept of the singleton set, one.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FSTAR<|>TWO<|>F* defines the concept of the set containing zero and one, two.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FSTAR<|>DELTA<|>F* is used to define and explore the properties of the delta set, leading to Russell's paradox.<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

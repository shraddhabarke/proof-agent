For example, Vale supports program proofs\nfor a structured assembly language; Low* provides effectful\nprogramming in F* with a C-like memory model; EverParse is a DSL for writing\nlow-level parsers and serializers. Recently, F* has gained new\nfeatures for building DSLs embedded in F* with customized syntax, type\nchecker plugins, extraction support, etc., with Pulse as a showcase\nexample of such a DSL.\n\nPulse is a new programming language embedded in F*, inheriting many of\nits features (notably, it is higher order and has dependent types),\nbut with built-in support for programming with mutable state and\nconcurrency, with specifications and proofs in Concurrent Separation\nLogic .\n\nAs a first taste of Pulse, here’s a function to increment a mutable\ninteger reference.\n\nfn incr (x:ref int)\nrequires pts_to x 'i\nensures pts_to x ('i + 1)\n{\n    let v = !x;\n    x := v + 1;\n}\n\n\nAnd here’s a function to increment two references in parallel.\n\nfn par_incr (x y:ref int)\nrequires pts_to x 'i ** pts_to y 'j\nensures pts_to x ('i + 1) ** pts_to y ('j + 1)\n{\n   par (fun _ -> incr x)\n       (fun _ -> incr y)\n}\n\n\nYou may not have heard about separation logic before—but perhaps\nthese specifications already make intuitive sense to you. The type of incr says that if “x points to ‘i” initially, then when incr returns, “x points to ‘i + 1”; while par_incr increments the\ncontents of x and y in parallel by using the par combinator.\n\nConcurrent separation logic is an active research area and there are\nmany such logics out there, all with different tradeoffs. Pulse’s\nlogic is based on a logic called PulseCore, formalized entirely within\nF*—you can find the formalization here . Proofs\nof programs in Pulse’s surface language correspond to proofs of\ncorrectness in the PulseCore program logic. But, you should not need\nto know much about how the logic is formalized to use Pulse\neffectively. We’ll start from the basics and explain what you need to\nknow about concurrent separation logic to start programming and\nproving in Pulse. Additionally, Pulse is an extension of F*, so all\nyou’ve learned about F*, lemmas, dependent types, refinement types,\netc. will be of use again.\n\nNote\n\nWhy is it called Pulse? Because it grew from a prior logic called Steel , and one of the\nauthors and his daughter are big fans of a classic reggae band\ncalled Steel Pulse . We wanted a name\nthat was softer than Steel, and, well, a bit playful. So, Pulse!\n\nContents:\n\n- Getting up and running with Codespaces\n\n- Pulse Basics\n\n- Mutable References\n\n- Existential Quantification\n\n- User-defined Predicates\n\n- Conditionals\n\n- Loops & Recursion\n\n- Mutable Arrays\n\n- Ghost Computations\n\n- Higher Order Functions\n\n- Implication and Universal Quantification\n\n- Linked Lists\n\n- Atomic Operations and Invariants\n\n- Spin Locks\n\n- Parallel Increment\n\n- Extraction\n\n© Copyright 2020, Microsoft Research.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PULSE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Pulse is a new programming language embedded in F*, designed for programming with mutable state and concurrency, and uses Concurrent Separation Logic for specifications and proofs)##\n(\"entity\"<|>F*<|>ORGANIZATION<|>F* is a programming language that supports building domain-specific languages (DSLs), including features for embedded DSLs with customized syntax and type checker plugins)##\n(\"entity\"<|>VALE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Vale is a DSL supported by F* for program proofs in a structured assembly language)##\n(\"entity\"<|>LOW*<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Low* provides effectful programming in F* with a C-like memory model)##\n(\"entity\"<|>EVERPARSE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>EverParse is a DSL for writing low-level parsers and serializers, supported by F*)##\n(\"entity\"<|>CONCURRENT SEPARATION LOGIC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A logic framework used by Pulse for programming with mutable state and concurrency, allowing specifications and proofs)##\n(\"entity\"<|>PULSECORE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>PulseCore is the logic on which Pulse's concurrent separation logic is based, formalized entirely within F*)##\n(\"entity\"<|>STEEL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Steel is a prior logic from which Pulse was developed, focusing on concurrent programming and proofs)##\n(\"entity\"<|>MICROSOFT RESEARCH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Microsoft Research is the organization credited with the copyright of the document, indicating their involvement or development of Pulse)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PULSE<|>F*<|>Pulse is embedded in F*, inheriting many of its features for DSL development<|>9)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PULSE<|>CONCURRENT SEPARATION LOGIC<|>Pulse uses Concurrent Separation Logic for its programming and proving capabilities<|>9)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PULSECORE<|>PULSE<|>Pulse's logic is based on PulseCore, indicating a direct relationship in their logical foundations<|>9)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STEEL<|>PULSE<|>Pulse was developed from the logic called Steel, showing a developmental lineage<|>8)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PULSE<|>MICROSOFT RESEARCH<|>Microsoft Research is mentioned in the context of copyright, suggesting their role in Pulse's development or sponsorship<|>7)<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

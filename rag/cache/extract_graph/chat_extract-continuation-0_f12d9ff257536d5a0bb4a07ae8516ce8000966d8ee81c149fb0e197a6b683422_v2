In F* this is slightly\nmore contrived due to squashed types, hence the need for an\n``implies_intro`` different from the ``intro``, explained ahead, that\nintroduces a binder.\n\nOther basic logical tactics include:\n\n  - ``forall_intro``: for a goal ``forall x. p``, introduce a fresh ``x`` into\n    the context and present a goal for ``p``.\n\n  - ``l_intros``: introduce both implications and foralls as much as\n    possible.\n\n  - ``split``: split a conjunction (``p /\\ q``) into two goals\n\n  - ``left``/``right``: prove a disjunction ``p \\/ q`` by proving ``p`` or ``q``\n\n  - ``assumption``: prove the goal from a hypothesis in the context.\n\n  - ``pose_lemma``: given a term ``t`` representing a lemma call, add its\n    postcondition to the context. If the lemma has a precondition, it is\n    presented as a separate goal.\n\nSee the `FStar.Tactics.Logic\n<https://github.com/FStarLang/FStar/blob/master/ulib/FStar.Tactics.Logic.fst>`_\nmodule for more.\n\nNormalizing and unfolding\n-------------------------\n\nWe have previously seen ``compute()``, which blasts a goal with F*'s\nnormalizer to reduce it into a *normal form*. We sometimes need a\nbit more control than that, and hence there are several tactics to\nnormalize goals in different ways. Most of them are implemented via a\nfew configurable primitives (you can look up their definitions in the\nstandard library)\n\n  - ``compute()``: calls the normalizer with almost all steps enabled\n\n  - ``simpl()``: simplifies logical operations (e.g. reduces ``p /\\ True``\n    to ``p``).\n\n  - ``whnf()`` (short for \"weak head normal form\"): reduces the goal\n    until its \"head\" is evident.\n\n  - ``unfold_def `t``: unfolds the definition of the name ``t`` in the goal,\n    fully normalizing its body.\n\n  - ``trivial()``: if the goal is trivial after normalization and simplification,\n    solve it.\n\nThe ``norm`` primitive provides fine-grained control. Its type is\n``list norm_step -> Tac unit``. The full list of ``norm_step`` s can\nbe found in the ``FStar.Pervasives`` module, and it is the same one\navailable for the ``norm`` marker in ``Pervasives`` (beware of the\nname clash between ``Tactics.norm`` and ``Pervasives.norm``!).\n\nInspecting and building syntax\n------------------------------\n\nAs part of automating proofs, we often need to inspect the syntax of\nthe goal and the hypotheses in the context to decide what to do. For\ninstance, instead of blindly trying to apply the ``split`` tactic (and\nrecovering if it fails), we could instead look at the *shape* of the\ngoal and apply ``split`` only if the goal has the shape ``p1 /\\ p2``.\n\nNote: inspecting syntax is, perhaps obviously, not something we can\njust do everywhere. If a function was allowed to inspect the syntax of\nits argument, it could behave differently on ``1+2`` and ``3``, which\nis bad, since ``1+2 == 3`` in F*, and functions are expected to map\nequal arguments to the same result. So, for the most part, we cannot\nsimply turn a value of type ``a`` into its syntax. Hence, quotations\nare *static*, they simply represent the syntax of a term and one\ncannot turn values into terms.  There is a more powerful mechanism of\n*dynamic quotations* that will be explained later, but suffice it to\nsay for now that this can only be done in the ``Tac`` effect.\n\nAs an example, the ``cur_goal()`` tactic will return a value of type\n``typ`` (an alias for ``term`` indicating that the term is really the\nrepresentation of an F* type) representing the syntax of the current\ngoal.\n\nThe ``term`` type is *abstract*: it has no observable structure\nitself. Think of it as an opaque \"box\" containing a term inside. A\npriori, all that can be done with a ``term`` is pass it to primitives\nthat expect one, such as ``tc`` to type-check it or ``norm_term`` to\nnormalize it. But none of those give us full, programatic access to\nthe structure of the term.\n\n\nThat's where the ``term_view`` comes in: following `a classic idea\nintroduced by Phil Wadler\n<https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/41625.41653>`_, there is function\ncalled ``inspect`` that turns a ``term`` into a ``term_view``. The\n``term_view`` type resembles an AST, but crucially it is not\nrecursive: its subterms have type ``term`` rather than ``term_view``.\n\n.. code-block::\n   :caption: Part of the ``term_view`` type.\n\n    noeq\n    type term_view =\n      | Tv_FVar   : v:fv -> term_view\n      | Tv_App    : hd:term -> a:argv -> term_view\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>FSTAR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>F* is a programming language designed for program verification, offering tactics for proving logical assertions and manipulating goals in proofs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IMPLIES_INTRO<|>EVENT<|>A tactic in F* for introducing a hypothesis to prove an implication)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FORALL_INTRO<|>EVENT<|>A tactic in F* for introducing a fresh variable into the context to prove a universal quantification)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>L_INTROS<|>EVENT<|>A tactic in F* that introduces both implications and universal quantifications as much as possible)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPLIT<|>EVENT<|>A tactic in F* used to split a conjunction into two separate goals)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LEFT<|>EVENT<|>A tactic in F* used to prove one side of a disjunction)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RIGHT<|>EVENT<|>A tactic in F* used to prove the other side of a disjunction)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ASSUMPTION<|>EVENT<|>A tactic in F* that proves a goal using a hypothesis already present in the context)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>POSE_LEMMA<|>EVENT<|>A tactic in F* for adding a lemma's postcondition to the context, potentially introducing its precondition as a separate goal)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COMPUTE<|>EVENT<|>A tactic in F* that calls the normalizer to reduce a goal to its normal form)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SIMPL<|>EVENT<|>A tactic in F* that simplifies logical operations)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WHNF<|>EVENT<|>A tactic in F* for reducing a goal until its head is evident, standing for 'weak head normal form')\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNFOLD_DEF<|>EVENT<|>A tactic in F* for unfolding the definition of a name in the goal)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TRIVIAL<|>EVENT<|>A tactic in F* that solves a goal if it is considered trivial after normalization and simplification)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>IMPLIES_INTRO<|>FSTAR<|>Implies_intro is a tactic used within the F* programming language for proof development<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FORALL_INTRO<|>FSTAR<|>Forall_intro is a tactic provided by F* for introducing variables in proofs<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>L_INTROS<|>FSTAR<|>L_intros is a tactic in F* for handling implications and quantifications<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SPLIT<|>FSTAR<|>Split is a tactic in F* used for dealing with conjunctions in proofs<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LEFT<|>FSTAR<|>Left is a tactic in F* for proving disjunctions by focusing on one side<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RIGHT<|>FSTAR<|>Right is a tactic in F* complementary to Left, focusing on proving the other side of disjunctions<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ASSUMPTION<|>FSTAR<|>Assumption is a tactic in F* that utilizes existing hypotheses for proving goals<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>POSE_LEMMA<|>FSTAR<|>Pose_lemma is a tactic in F* for leveraging lemmas in proof development<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COMPUTE<|>FSTAR<|>Compute is a normalization tactic in F* for simplifying goals<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SIMPL<|>FSTAR<|>Simpl is a tactic in F* for logical operation simplification<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WHNF<|>FSTAR<|>Whnf is a tactic in F* for reducing goals to a weak head normal form<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>UNFOLD_DEF<|>FSTAR<|>Unfold_def is a tactic in F* for expanding definitions within goals<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TRIVIAL<|>FSTAR<|>Trivial is a tactic in F* for solving goals deemed simple after normalization<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

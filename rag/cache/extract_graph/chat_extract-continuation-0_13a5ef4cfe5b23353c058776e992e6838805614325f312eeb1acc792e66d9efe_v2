Since they are at the bottom of the\nhierarchy, Tot computations can only depend on other Tot computations, ensuring that F*’s logical core remains total.\n\nEvery term in F* is typechecked to have a computation type. This\nincludes the total terms we have been working with. Such terms are\nclassified in the default effect called Tot , the effect of total\ncomputations that do not have any observable effect, aside from the\nvalue they return. Any meaning or intuition that we have ascribed to\ntyping e:t extends to e:Tot t . For example, if e:Tot t ,\nthen at runtime, e terminates and produces a value of type t . In addition, since its effect label is Tot , it has no\nside-effect.\n\nIn fact, as we have already seen ,\nnotationally x:t0 -> t1 is a shorthand for x:t0 -> Tot t1 (where t1 could itself be an arrow type). More generally, arrow\ntypes in F* take the form x:t -> C , representing a function with\nargument type t0 and body computation type C (which may depend\non x ).\n\nSimilarly, the return type annotation that we have seen in the let definitions is also a shorthand, e.g., the id function\n\nlet id (a:Type) (x:a) : a = x\n\n\nis a shorthand for\n\nlet id (a:Type) (x:a) : Tot a = x  //the return type annotation is a computation type\n\n\nand the type of id is a:Type -> a -> Tot a . More generally,\nthe return type annotations on let definitions are computation\ntypes C .\n\nThe explicit annotation syntax e <: t behaves a little differently. F* allows writing e <: C , and\nchecks that e indeed has computation type C . But when the\neffect label is omitted, e <: t , it is interpreted as e <: _ t , where the omitted effect label is inferred by F* and does not\ndefault to Tot .\n\nFor pure functions, the evaluation order is irrelevant. [ 1 ] F*\nprovides abstract machines to interpret pure terms using either a lazy\nevaluation strategy or a call-by-value strategy (see a forthcoming chapter on F*’s normalizers ). Further, compiling pure programs to OCaml, F*\ninherits the OCaml’s call-by-value semantics for pure terms.\n\nWhen evaluating function calls with effectful arguments, the arguments\nare reduced to values first, exhibiting their effects, if any, prior\nto the function call. That is, where e1 and e2 may be\neffectful, the application e1 e2 is analogous to bind f = e1 in bind x = e2 in f x : in fact, internally this is what F* elaborates e1 e2 to, when either of them may have non-trivial effects.  As\nsuch, for effectful terms, F* enforces a left-to-right, call-by-value semantics for\neffectful terms.\n\nSince only the value returned by a computation is passed as an\nargument to a function, function argument types in F* are always value\ntypes. That is, they always have the form t -> C . To pass a\ncomputation as an argument to another function, you must encapsulate\nthe computation in a function, e.g., in place of C -> C , one can\nwrite (unit -> C) -> C' . Since functions are first-class values in\nF*, including functions whose body may have non-trivial effects, one\ncan always do this.\n\nSince F* is an extensional type theory, pure F* terms are only weakly normalizing. That is, some evaluation strategies\n(e.g., repeatedly reducing a recursive function deep in an\ninfeasible code path) need not terminate. However, for every\nclosed, pure term, there is a reduction strategy that will\nreduce it fully. As such, the evaluation order for pure\nfunctions is irrelevant, except that some choices of evaluation\norder may lead to non-termination.\n\n© Copyright 2020, Microsoft Research.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>TOT<|>EVENT<|>Tot represents the effect of total computations in F*, indicating computations that are pure and have no side-effects aside from returning a value)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>F*<|>ORGANIZATION<|>F* is a programming language designed with a focus on formal verification, featuring a type system that includes computation types and effect labels to ensure the totality and purity of functions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OCAML<|>ORGANIZATION<|>OCaml is a programming language that F* compiles pure programs to, inheriting OCaml's call-by-value semantics for pure terms)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TOT<|>F*<|>Tot is a concept within F* that categorizes pure, total functions, ensuring they depend only on other Tot computations<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>F*<|>OCAML<|>F* compiles pure programs to OCaml, adopting its call-by-value semantics for these terms<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

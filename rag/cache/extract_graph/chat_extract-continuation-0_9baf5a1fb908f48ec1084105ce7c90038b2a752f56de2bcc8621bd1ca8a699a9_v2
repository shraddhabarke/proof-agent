Given the constraints and the nature of the text, it appears there was a misunderstanding in identifying relevant entities and relationships from the provided programming context. The text primarily discusses programming functions, lemmas, and tactics within a formal verification or theorem proving environment, which do not directly correspond to the specified entity types (organization, person, geo, event). \n\nHowever, if we were to interpret the request in the broadest sense possible, considering \"organization\" to encompass organized constructs or systems within a programming language or framework, and there's still no direct match to \"person,\" \"geo,\" or \"event\" types within the given text. The entities extracted were based on this broad interpretation, focusing on functions and lemmas as \"organizations\" in the context of a programming language's organized constructs.\n\nIf the task were to identify programming constructs, functions, or lemmas, the output provided would be relevant. However, based on the specified entity types, the text does not contain information that fits the \"person,\" \"geo,\" or \"event\" categories, and the interpretation of \"organization\" was stretched to include programming constructs for the purpose of providing an output.\n\nFor accurate extraction according to the initial instructions, the text would need to contain explicit references to real-world organizations, people, geographical locations, or events.

From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n \n3.

We illustrate the extraction capabilities\nwith the help of the Boyer-Moore majority vote algorithm implemented in Pulse.\n\nThe algorithm finds majority vote in an array of votes in linear time\n(2n comparisons, where n is the length of the array) and constant extra memory.\n\nWe implement the algorithm in Pulse with the following specification:\n\nlet count (#a:eqtype) (x:a) (s:Seq.seq a) : GTot nat = Seq.count x s\n\nnoextract\nlet has_majority_in (#a:eqtype) (x:a) (s:Seq.seq a) = Seq.length s < 2 * count x s\n\nnoextract\nlet no_majority (#a:eqtype) (s:Seq.seq a) = forall (x:a). ~(x `has_majority_in` s)\n\n```pulse\nfn majority\n  (#[@@@ Rust_generics_bounds [\"Copy\"; \"PartialEq\"]] a:eqtype)\n  #p (#s:G.erased _) (votes:array a) (len:SZ.t { SZ.v len == Seq.length s })\n  requires pts_to votes #p s ** pure (0 < SZ.v len /\\ SZ.fits (2 * SZ.v len))\n  returns x:option a\n  ensures pts_to votes #p s **\n          pure ((x == None ==> no_majority s) /\\ (Some? x ==> (Some?.v x) `has_majority_in` s))\n\n\nThe precondition SZ.fits (2 * SZ.v len) ensures safe arithmetic when counting\nfor majority.\n\nThe algorithm consists of two phases. The first phase, called the pairing phase,\npairs off disagreeing votes (cancels them) until the remaining votes are all same.\nThe main idea of the algorithm is to do this pairing with n comparisons. After the\npairing phase, the remaining vote must be the majority, if the majority exists .\nThe second phase, called the counting phase, checks if the remaining vote is indeed\nin majority with n more comparisons.\n\nFor the first phase, the algorithm maintains three auxiliary variables, i for the\nloop counter, cand the current majority candidate, and a count k . It visits the\nvotes in a loop, where for the i-th element of the array, if k = 0 , the algorithm assigns the i-th vote as the new\nmajority candidate and assigns k = 1 . Otherwise, if the i-th vote is same as cand , it increments k by one, otherwise it decrements k by one.\n\nThe second phase then is another while loop that counts the number of votes\nfor the majority candidate from the first phase.\n\n{\n  let mut i = 1sz;\n  let mut k = 1sz;\n  let votes_0 = votes.(0sz);\n  let mut cand = votes_0;\n  assert (pure (count_until votes_0 s 1 == 1));\n  // while loop for phase 1\n  while (\n    let vi = !i;\n    (vi <^ len)\n  )\n  invariant b.\n    pts_to votes #p s **\n    (exists* vi vk vcand.\n       R.pts_to i vi       **\n       R.pts_to k vk       **\n       R.pts_to cand vcand **\n       pure (\n         v vi <= Seq.length s /\\\n         // v is a spec function that returns nat representation of an FStar.SizeT\n         0 <= v vk /\\ v vk <= count_until vcand s (v vi) /\\\n         // constraint for the current candidate,\n         2 * (count_until vcand s (v vi) - v vk) <= v vi - v vk /\\\n         // constraint for the rest of the candidates\n         (forall (vcand':a). vcand' =!= vcand ==> 2 * count_until vcand' s (v vi) <= v vi - v vk) /\\\n         b == (v vi < v len)))\n  {\n    let vi = !i;\n    let vk = !k;\n    let vcand = !cand;\n    let votes_i = votes.(vi);\n    // count_until_next is a lemma that captures the behavior of\n    // count when the sequence index is incremented\n    count_until_next vcand s (SZ.v vi);\n    if (vk = 0sz) {\n      cand := votes_i;\n      k := 1sz;\n      i := vi +^ 1sz\n    } else if (votes_i = vcand) {\n      k := vk +^ 1sz;\n      i := vi +^ 1sz\n    } else {\n      k := vk -^ 1sz;\n      i := vi +^ 1sz\n    }\n  };\n  let vk = !k;\n  let vcand = !cand;\n  // a couple of optimizations\n  if (vk = 0sz) {\n    None #a\n  } else if (len <^ 2sz *^ vk) {\n    Some vcand\n  } else {\n    i := 0sz;\n    k := 0sz;\n    // while loop for phase 2\n    while (\n      let vi = !i;\n      (vi <^ len)\n    )\n    invariant b.\n      pts_to votes #p s **\n      (exists* vi vk.\n         R.pts_to i vi **\n         R.pts_to k vk **\n         pure (SZ.v vi <= Seq.length s /\\\n               SZ.v vk == count_until vcand s (SZ.v vi) /\\\n               b == (SZ.v vi < SZ.v len)))\n    {\n      let vi = !i;\n      let vk = !k;\n      let votes_i = votes.(vi);\n      count_until\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>OCAML<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A programming language to which Pulse programs can be extracted\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>C<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A programming language to which Pulse programs can be extracted\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RUST<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A programming language to which Pulse programs can be extracted\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PULSE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A programming platform or language that implements the Boyer-Moore majority vote algorithm and supports extraction to OCaml, C, and Rust\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BOYER-MOORE MAJORITY VOTE ALGORITHM<|>EVENT<|>An algorithm implemented in Pulse that finds the majority vote in an array of votes in linear time and constant extra memory\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PULSE<|>OCAML<|>Pulse programs can be extracted to OCaml<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PULSE<|>C<|>Pulse programs can be extracted to C<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PULSE<|>RUST<|>Pulse programs can be extracted to Rust<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PULSE<|>BOYER-MOORE MAJORITY VOTE ALGORITHM<|>The Boyer-Moore majority vote algorithm is implemented in Pulse<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

Our first non-trivial effect separates the\ncomputationally relevant parts of the program from the computationally\nirrelevant (i.e., specificational or *ghost*) parts of a program. This\nseparation enables the F* compiler to guarantee that all the ghost\nparts of a program are optimized away entirely.\n\nFor a glimpse of what all of this is about, let's take a look again at\nlength-indexed vectors---we saw them first :ref:`here <Part2_vectors>`.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Vec.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: vec\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: vec\n\nand a function to concatenate two vectors:\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Vec.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: append\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: append\n\nCompare this with concatenating two lists:\n\n.. code-block:: fstar\n\n   let rec list_append #a (l1 l2:list a) =\n       match l1 with\n       | [] -> []\n       | hd::tl -> hd :: list_append tl l2\n\nSuperficially, because of the implicit arguments, it may look like\nconcatenating vectors with ``append`` is just as efficient as a\nconcatenating lists---the length indexes seem to impose no\noverhead. But, let's look at the code that F* extracts to OCaml for\nlength-indexed vectors.\n\nFirst, in the definition of the ``vec`` type, since OCaml is not\ndependently typed, the ``nat``-index of the F* ``vec`` is replaced by\na ``'dummy`` type argument---that's fine. But, notice that the\n``Cons`` constructor contains three fields: a ``Prims.nat`` for the\nlength of the tail of the list, the head of the list, and then then\ntail, i.e., the length of the tail of the list is stored at every\n``Cons`` cell, so the ``vec`` type is actually less space efficient\nthan an ordinary ``list``.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Vec.ml\n   :language: ocaml\n   :start-after: (* SNIPPET_START: vec *)\n   :end-before: (* SNIPPET_END: vec *)\n\nNext, in the OCaml definition of ``append``, we see that it receives\nadditional arguments ``n`` and ``m`` for the lengths of the vectors,\nand worse, in the last case, it incurs an addition to sum ``n' + m``\nwhen building the result vector. So, ``append`` is also less\ntime-efficient than ``List.append``.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Vec.ml\n   :language: ocaml\n   :start-after: (* SNIPPET_START: append *)\n   :end-before: (* SNIPPET_END: append *)\n\nThis is particularly unfortunate, since the computational behavior of\n``append`` doesn't actually depend on the length indexes of the input\nvectors. What we need is a principled way to indicate to the F\\*\ncompiler that some parts of a computation are actually only there for\nspecification or proof purposes and that they can be removed when\ncompiling the code, without changing the observable result computed by\nthe program. This is what *erasure* is about---removing the\ncomputationally irrelevant parts of a term for compilation. \n\nHere's a revised version of vectors, making use of the ``erased`` type\nfrom the ``FStar.Ghost`` library to indicate to F* which parts must be\nerased by the compiler.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/VecErased.fst\n   :language: fstar\n\nWe'll look into this in much more detail in what follows, but notice\nfor now that:\n\n  1. The first argument of ``Cons`` now has type ``erased nat``.\n\n  2. The implicit arguments of ``append`` corresponding to the\n     indexes of the input vectors have type ``erased nat``.\n\nIf we extract this code to OCaml, here's what we get:\n\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/VecErased.ml\n   :language: ocaml\n   :start-after: (* SNIPPET_START: vec *)\n   :end-before: (* SNIPPET_END: vec *)\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/VecErased.ml\n   :language: ocaml\n   :start-after: (* SNIPPET_START: append *)\n   :end-before: (* SNIPPET_END: append *)\n\nNotice that the erased arguments have all been turned into the unit\nvalue ``()``, and the needless addition in ``append`` is gone too.\n\nOf course, the code would be cleaner if F* were to have entirely\nremoved the argument instead of leaving behind a unit term, but we\nleave it to the downstream compiler, e.g., OCaml itself, to remove\nthese needless units. Further, if we're compiling the ML code\nextracted from F* to C, then KaRaMeL does remove these additional\nunits in the C code it produces.\n\n\nGhost: A Primitive Effect\n-------------------------\n\nThe second, primitive effect in F*'s effect system is the effect of\n*ghost* computations, i.e., computation types whose effect label is\n``GTot``. [#]_ The label ``GTot`` is strictly above ``Tot`` in the\neffect hierarchy, i.e.,\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>F* COMPILER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The F* compiler is responsible for optimizing away the computationally irrelevant (ghost) parts of a program)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LENGTH-INDEXED VECTORS<|>EVENT<|>An example used to illustrate the separation of computationally relevant and irrelevant parts in a program)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OCAML<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A programming language to which F* code is extracted, showing the efficiency comparison between vector and list operations)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FSTAR.GHOST LIBRARY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A library in F* that provides the 'erased' type to indicate which parts of the code should be erased by the compiler)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ERASURE<|>EVENT<|>The process of removing computationally irrelevant parts of a term for compilation in F*)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KARAMEL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A compiler that can further optimize ML code extracted from F* by removing additional units in the C code it produces)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>F* COMPILER<|>LENGTH-INDEXED VECTORS<|>The F* compiler uses the example of length-indexed vectors to demonstrate the separation of computationally relevant and irrelevant parts<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>F* COMPILER<|>FSTAR.GHOST LIBRARY<|>The F* compiler utilizes the FStar.Ghost library to indicate which parts of the code should be erased<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>F* COMPILER<|>ERASURE<|>Erasure is a concept applied by the F* compiler to optimize program code<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OCAML<|>LENGTH-INDEXED VECTORS<|>OCaml is used to show the efficiency of operations on length-indexed vectors extracted from F*<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KARAMEL<|>OCAML<|>KaRaMeL optimizes the ML code extracted to OCaml from F* for C compilation by removing additional units<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

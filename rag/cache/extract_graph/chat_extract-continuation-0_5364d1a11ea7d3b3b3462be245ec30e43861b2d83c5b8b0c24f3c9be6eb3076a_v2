We may sleep to-night with light\nhearts, Caroline!'\n\nYes. Soften it as they would, their hearts were lighter. The children's\nfaces, hushed and clustered round to hear what they so little\nunderstood, were brighter; and it was a happier house for this man's\ndeath! The only emotion that the Ghost could show him, caused by the\nevent, was one of pleasure.\n\n'Let me see some tenderness connected with a death,' said Scrooge; 'or\nthat dark chamber, Spirit, which we left just now, will be for ever\npresent to me.'\n\nThe Ghost conducted him through several streets familiar to his feet;\nand as they went along, Scrooge looked here and there to find himself,\nbut nowhere was he to be seen. They entered poor Bob Cratchit's house;\nthe dwelling he had visited before; and found the mother and the\nchildren seated round the fire.\n\nQuiet. Very quiet. The noisy little Cratchits were as still as statues\nin one corner, and sat looking up at Peter, who had a book before him.\nThe mother and her daughters were engaged in sewing. But surely they\nwere very quiet!\n\n'\"And he took a child, and set him in the midst of them.\"'\n\nWhere had Scrooge heard those words? He had not dreamed them. The boy\nmust have read them out as he and the Spirit crossed the threshold. Why\ndid he not go on?\n\nThe mother laid her work upon the table, and put her hand up to her\nface.\n\n'The colour hurts my eyes,' she said.\n\nThe colour? Ah, poor Tiny Tim!\n\n'They're better now again,' said Cratchit's wife. 'It makes them weak by\ncandle-light; and I wouldn't show weak eyes to your father when he comes\nhome for the world. It must be near his time.'\n\n'Past it rather,' Peter answered, shutting up his book. 'But I think he\nhas walked a little slower than he used, these few last evenings,\nmother.'\n\nThey were very quiet again. At last she said, and in a steady, cheerful\nvoice, that only faltered once:\n\n'I have known him walk with--I have known him walk with Tiny Tim upon\nhis shoulder very fast indeed.'\n\n'And so have I,' cried Peter. 'Often.'\n\n'And so have I,' exclaimed another. So had all.\n\n'But he was very light to carry,' she resumed, intent upon her work,\n'and his father loved him so, that it was no trouble, no trouble. And\nthere is your father at the door!'\n\nShe hurried out to meet him; and little Bob in his comforter--he had\nneed of it, poor fellow--came in. His tea was ready for him on the hob,\nand they all tried who should help him to it most. Then the two young\nCratchits got upon his knees, and laid, each child, a little cheek\nagainst his face, as if they said, 'Don't mind it, father. Don't be\ngrieved!'\n\nBob was very cheerful with them, and spoke pleasantly to all the family.\nHe looked at the work upon the table, and praised the industry and speed\nof Mrs. Cratchit and the girls. They would be done long before Sunday,\nhe said.\n\n'Sunday! You went to-day, then, Robert?' said his wife.\n\n'Yes, my dear,' returned Bob. 'I wish you could have gone. It would have\ndone you good to see how green a place it is. But you'll see it often. I\npromised him that I would walk there on a Sunday. My little, little\nchild!' cried Bob. 'My little child!'\n\nHe broke down all at once. He couldn't help it. If he could have helped\nit, he and his child would have been farther apart, perhaps, than they\nwere.\n\nHe left the room, and went upstairs into the room above, which was\nlighted cheerfully, and hung with Christmas. There was a chair set close\nbeside the child, and there were signs of some one having been there\nlately. Poor Bob sat down in it, and when he had thought a little and\ncomposed himself, he kissed the little face. He was reconciled to what\nhad happened, and went down again quite happy.\n\nThey drew about the fire, and talked, the girls and mother working\nstill. Bob told them of the extraordinary kindness of Mr. Scrooge's\nnephew, whom he had scarcely seen but once, and who, meeting him in the\nstreet that day, and seeing that he looked a little--'just a little\ndown, you know,' said Bob, inquired what had happened to distress him.\n'On which,' said Bob, 'for he is the pleasantest-spoken gentleman you\never heard, I told him. \"I am heartily sorry for it, Mr. Cratchit,\" he\nsaid, \"and heartily sorry for your good wife.\" By-the-bye, how he ever\nknew _that_ I don't know.'\n\n'Knew what, my dear?'\n\n'Why, that you were a good wife,' replied Bob.\n\n'Everybody knows that,' said Peter.\n\n'Very well observed, my boy!' cried Bob. 'I hope they do. \"Heartily\nsorry,\" he said, \"for your good wife. If I can be of service to you in\nany way,\" he said, giving me his card, \"that's where I live.

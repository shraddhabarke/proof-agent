However, not all derived instances\nare due to explicit inheritance—some instances can be computed from others.\n\nFor example, here’s a class eq for types that support decidable\nequality.\n\nclass eq (a:Type) = {\n  eq_op: a -> a -> bool;\n\n  [@@@TC.no_method]\n  properties : squash (\n    forall x y. eq_op x y <==> x == y\n  )\n}\n\nlet ( =?= ) #a {| eq a |} (x y: a) = eq_op x y\n\n\nWe’ll write x =?= y for an equality comparison method from this\nclass, to not confuse it with F*’s built-in decidable equality (=) on eqtype .\n\nNow, from an instance of bounded_unsigned_int_ops a we can\ncompute an instance of eq a , since we have <^ , a strict\ncomparison operator that we know is equivalent to < on natural\nnumbers. F*, from all the properties we have on bounded_unsigned_int_ops and its base class bounded_unsigned_int , can automatically prove that not (x <^ y) && not (y <^ x) is valid if and only if x == y . This instance of eq now also lets us easily implement a non-strict comparison\noperation on bounded unsigned ints.\n\ninstance bounded_unsigned_int_ops_eq #a {| bounded_unsigned_int_ops a |}\n  : eq a\n  = {\n      eq_op = (fun x y -> not (x <^ y) && not (y <^ x));\n      properties = ()\n    }\n\nlet ( <=^ ) #a {| bounded_unsigned_int_ops a |} (x y : a)\n  : bool\n  = x <^ y || x =?= y\n\n\nWe can easily provide ground instances of bounded_unsigned_int_ops for all the F* bounded unsigned int types—we show instances for FStar.UInt32.t and FStar.UInt64.t , where the proof of all the\nproperties needed to construct the instances is automated.\n\nmodule U32 = FStar.UInt32\nmodule U64 = FStar.UInt64\ninstance u32_instance_base : bounded_unsigned_int U32.t =\n  let open U32 in\n  {\n    bound    = 0xfffffffful;\n    as_nat   = v;\n    from_nat = uint_to_t;\n    properties = ()\n}\n\ninstance u32_instance_ops : bounded_unsigned_int_ops U32.t =\n  let open U32 in\n  {\n    base = u32_instance_base;\n    add  = (fun x y -> add x y);\n    sub  = (fun x y -> sub x y);\n    lt   = (fun x y -> lt x y);\n    properties = ()\n  }\n\n\ninstance u64_instance_base : bounded_unsigned_int U64.t =\n  let open U64 in\n  {\n    bound    = 0xffffffffffffffffuL;\n    as_nat   = v;\n    from_nat = uint_to_t;\n    properties = ()\n}\n\ninstance u64_instance_ops : bounded_unsigned_int_ops U64.t =\n  let open U64 in\n  {\n    base = u64_instance_base;\n    add  = (fun x y -> add x y);\n    sub  = (fun x y -> sub x y);\n    lt   = (fun x y -> lt x y);\n    properties = ()\n  }\n\n\nAnd one can check that typeclass resolution works well on those ground\ninstances.\n\nlet test32 (x:U32.t)\n           (y:U32.t)\n  = if x <=^ 0xffffffful &&\n       y <=^ 0xffffffful\n    then Some (x +^ y)\n    else None\n\nlet test64 (x y:U64.t)\n  = if x <=^ 0xfffffffuL &&\n       y <=^ 0xfffffffuL\n    then Some (x +^ y)\n    else None\n\n\nFinally, as promised at the start, we can write functions that are\ngeneric over all bounded unsigned integers, something we couldn’t do\nwith interfaces alone.\n\nmodule L = FStar.List.Tot\nlet sum #a {| bounded_unsigned_int_ops a |}\n        (l:list a) (acc:a)\n  : option a \n  = L.fold_right\n     (fun (x:a) (acc:option a) ->\n       match acc with\n       | None -> None\n       | Some y ->\n         if x <=^ bound -^ y\n         then Some (x +^ y)\n         else None)\n     l\n     (Some acc)\n\nlet testsum32 : U32.t = Some?.v (sum [0x01ul; 0x02ul; 0x03ul] 0x00ul)\nlet testsum64 : U64.t = Some?.v (sum [0x01uL; 0x02uL; 0x03uL] 0x00uL)\n\n\nF* can prove that the bounds check in sum is sufficient to prove\nthat the addition does not overflow, and further, that the two tests\nreturn Some _ without failing due to overflow.\n\nHowever, the proving that Some?

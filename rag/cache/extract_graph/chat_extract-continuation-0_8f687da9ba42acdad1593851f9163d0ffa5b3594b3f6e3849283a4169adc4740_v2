Further,\nwhen specifications written as Hoare triples naturally induce\nmonotonic WPs.\n\nF* provides an effect abbreviation called Pure for writing and\ntypechecking Hoare-style specifications for pure programs, and is\ndefined as shown below in prims.fst :\n\neffect Pure (a:Type) (req:Type0) (ens:a -> Type0) =\n       PURE a (fun post -> req /\\ (forall x. ens x ==> post x))\n\n\nThe signature of Pure is Pure a req ens , where req is the\nprecondition and ens:a -> Type0 is the postcondition. Using Pure , we can write the factorial function we saw at the top of\nthis chapterâ€”F* infers a PURE a wp type for it, and relates it\nto the annotated Pure int req ens type, proving that the latter\nhas a stronger precondition and weaker postcondition.\n\nOne may wonder when one should write specifications using the notation x:a -> Pure b req ens versus x:a{req} -> Tot (y:b { ens y }) . The two styles are closely related and choosing between them is\nmostly a matter of taste. As you have seen, until this point in the\nbook, we have not used Pure a req ens at all. However, when a\nfunction has many pre and postconditions, it is sometimes more\nconvenient to use the Pure a req ens notation, rather than\nstuffing all the constraints in refinement types.\n\nJust as PURE is an wp-indexed refinement of Tot , F* provides\ntwo more primitive wp-indexed effects:\n\n- GHOST (a:Type) (w:wp a) is a refinement of GTot a\n\n- DIV (a:Type) (w:wp a) is a refinement of Dv a\n\nThat is, F* uses the GHOST effect to infer total correctness WPs\nfor ghost computations, where, internally, GTot a is equivalent to GHOST a (fun post -> forall x. post x)\n\nLikewise, F* uses the DIV effect to infer partial correctness WPs for potentially non-terminating computations, where, internally, Dv a is equivalent to DIV a (fun post -> forall x. post x) .\n\nAs with Tot and PURE , F* automatically relates GTot and GHOST computations, and Dv and DIV computations. Further,\nthe effect ordering Tot < Dv and Tot < GTot extends to PURE < DIV and PURE < GHOST as well.\n\nThe prims.fst library also provides Hoare-triple style\nabbreviations for GHOST and DIV , i.e.,\n\neffect Ghost a req ens = GHOST a (fun post -> req /\\ (forall x. ens x /\\ post x))\neffect Div a req ens = DIV a (fun post -> req /\\ (forall x. ens x /\\ post x))\n\n\nThese Hoare-style abbreviations are more convenient to use than their\nmore primitive WP-based counterparts.\n\nThe tradeoffs of using Ghost vs. GTot or Div vs. Dv are similar to those for Pure vs Tot â€”itâ€™s mostly a matter of\ntaste. In fact, there are relatively few occurrences of Pure , Ghost , and Div in most F* codebases. However, there is one\nimportant exception: Lemma .\n\nWe can finally unveil the definition of the Lemma syntax, which we\nintroduced as a syntactic shorthand in an early chapter . In fact, Lemma is defined in prims.fst as follows:\n\neffect Lemma (a: eqtype_u)\n             (pre: Type)\n             (post: (squash pre -> Type))\n             (smt_pats: list pattern) =\n       Pure a pre (fun r -> post ())\n\n\nThat is, Lemma is an instance of the Hoare-style refinement of\npure computations Pure a req ens .  So, when you write a proof term\nand annotate it as e : Lemma (requires pre) (ensures post) , F*\ninfers a specification for e : PURE a wp , and then, as with all\nPURE computations, F* tries to check that the annotated Lemma specification has a stronger WP-specification than the computed\nweakest precondition.\n\nOf course, F* still includes syntactic sugar for Lemma , e.g., Lemma (requires pre) (ensures post) is desugared to Lemma unit pre (fun _ -> post) [] . The last argument of a lemma, the smt_pats are used to introduce lemmas to the SMT solver for proof\nautomationâ€”a later chapter covers that in detail.\n\nFinally, notice the type of the post , which assumes squash pre as an argumentâ€“this is what allows the ensures clause of a Lemma to assume that what was specified in the `requires clause.\n\nÂ© Copyright 2020, Microsoft Research.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PURE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Pure is an effect in F* for writing and typechecking Hoare-style specifications for pure programs)##\n(\"entity\"<|>GHOST<|>ORGANIZATION<|>GHOST is an effect in F* used to infer total correctness WPs for ghost computations)##\n(\"entity\"<|>DIV<|>ORGANIZATION<|>DIV is an effect in F* used to infer partial correctness WPs for potentially non-terminating computations)##\n(\"entity\"<|>LEMMA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Lemma is a syntactic shorthand in F* for a Hoare-style refinement of pure computations)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PURE<|>GHOST<|>PURE is a base for more specific effects like GHOST, indicating a hierarchy of effect refinements in F*<|>3)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PURE<|>DIV<|>PURE is a base for more specific effects like DIV, showing a hierarchy of effect refinements in F*<|>3)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GHOST<|>DIV<|>Both GHOST and DIV are refinements of PURE, indicating they share a common foundation but diverge in their specific applications<|>2)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LEMMA<|>PURE<|>Lemma is an instance of the Hoare-style refinement of pure computations, directly related to PURE<|>9)<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

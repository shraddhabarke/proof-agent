Encoding\nthese modules consumes about 150,000 lines of SMT2 definitions and\ncomments.\n\nThe encoding of each module is delimited in the .smt2 file by comments\nof the following kind:\n\n;;; Start module Prims\n...\n;;; End module Prims (1334 decls; total size 431263)\n\n;;; Start module FStar.Pervasives.Native\n...\n;;; End module FStar.Pervasives.Native (2643 decls; total size 2546449)\n\n;;; Start interface FStar.Pervasives\n...\n;;; End interface FStar.Pervasives (2421 decls; total size 1123058)\n\n\nwhere each End line also describes the number of declarations in\nthe module and its length in characters.\n\nDespite SMT2 being a multi-sorted logic, aside from the pervasive use\nthe SMT sort Bool , F*’s encoding to SMT (mostly) uses just a\nsingle sort: every pure (or ghost) F* term is encoded to the SMT\nsolver as an instance of an uninterpreted SMT sort called Term . This allows the encoding to be very general, handling F*’s\nmuch richer type system, rather than trying to map F*’s complex type\nsystem into the much simpler type system of SMT sorts.\n\nOne of the most primitive sorts in the SMT solver is Bool , the\nsort of Booleans. All the logical connectives in SMT are operations on\nthe Bool sort. To encode values of the F* type bool to SMT, we\nuse the Bool sort, but since all F* terms are encoded to the Term sort, we “box” the Bool sort to promote it to Term ,\nusing the SMT2 definitions below.\n\n(declare-fun BoxBool (Bool) Term)\n(declare-fun BoxBool_proj_0 (Term) Bool)\n(assert (! (forall ((@u0 Bool))\n                   (! (= (BoxBool_proj_0 (BoxBool @u0))\n                          @u0)\n                       :pattern ((BoxBool @u0))\n                       :qid projection_inverse_BoxBool_proj_0))\n            :named projection_inverse_BoxBool_proj_0))\n\n\nThis declares two uninterpreted functions BoxBool and BoxBool_proj_0 that go back and forth between the sorts Bool and Term .\n\nThe axiom named projection_inverse_BoxBool_proj_0 states that BoxBool_proj_0 is the inverse of BoxBool , or, equivalently,\nthat BoxBool is an injective function from Bool to Term .\n\nThe qid is the quantifier identifier, usually equal to or derived\nfrom the name of the assumption that includes it—qids come up when\nwe look at profiling quantifier instantiation .\n\nThe projection_inverse_BoxBool_proj_0 axiom on booleans shows our\nfirst use of a quantified formula with a pattern, i.e., the part that\nsays :pattern ((BoxBool @u0)) . These patterns are the main\nheuristic used to control the SMT solver’s proof search and will\nfeature repeatedly in the remainder of this chapter.\n\nWhen exploring a theory, the SMT solver has a current partial model\nwhich contains an assignment for some of the variables in a theory to\nground terms. All the terms that appear in this partial model are\ncalled active terms and these active terms play a role in quantifier\ninstantiation.\n\nEach universally quantified formula in scope is a term of the form below:\n\n(forall ((x1 s1) ... (xn sn))\n        (! (  body  )\n         :pattern ((p1) ... (pm))))\n\n\nThis quantified formula is inert and only plays a role in the solver’s\nsearch once the bound variables x1 ... xn are instantiated. The\nterms p1 ... pm are called patterns, and collectively, p1 ... pm must mention all the bound variables. To instantiate the\nquantifier, the solver aims to find active terms v1...vm that\nmatch the patterns p1..pm , where a match involves finding a\nsubstitution S for the bound variables x1...xm , such that the\nsubstituted patterns S(p1...pm) are equal to the active terms v1..vm . Given such a substitution, the substituted term S(body) becomes active and may refine the partial model further.\n\nExistentially quantified formulas are dual to universally quantified\nformulas. Whereas a universal formula in the context (i.e., in\nnegative position, or as a hypothesis) is inert until its pattern is\ninstantiated, an existential goal (or, in positive position) is\ninert until its pattern is instantiated. Existential quantifiers can\nbe decorated with patterns that trigger instantiation when matched\nwith active terms, just like universal quantifiers\n\nReturning to projection_inverse_BoxBool_proj_0 , what this means is\nthat once the solver has an active term BoxBool b , it can\ninstantiate the quantified formula to obtain (= (BoxBool_proj_0 (BoxBool b)) b) .\n\nThe encoding of the F* type int is similar to that of bool —the primitive SMT sort Int (of unbounded mathematical\nintegers) are coerced to Term using the injective function BoxInt .\n\n(declare-fun BoxInt (Int) Term)\n(declare-fun BoxInt_proj_0 (Term) Int)\n(assert (! (forall ((@u0 Int))\n                   (! (= (BoxInt_proj_0 (BoxInt @u0))\n                         @u0)\n                      :pattern ((BoxInt @u0))\n                      :qid projection_inverse_BoxInt_proj_0))\n           :named projection_inverse_BoxInt_proj_0))\n\n\nThe primitive operations on integers are encoded by unboxing the\narguments and boxing the result.

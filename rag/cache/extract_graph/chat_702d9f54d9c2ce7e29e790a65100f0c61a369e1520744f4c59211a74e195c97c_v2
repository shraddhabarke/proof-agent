This\n   is necessary if you want to understand a bit about how F* infers\n   the logical constraints needed to prove the correctness of a\n   program. It is also useful background for more advanced material in\n   subsequent chapters about defining custom effects in F*, e.g.,\n   effects to model state, exceptions, or concurrency.\n\nRefinement types ``x:t{p}`` *refine* value types ``t`` and allow us to\nmake more precise assertions about the values in the program. For\nexample, when we have ``v : x:int{x >= 0}``, then not only we know\nthat ``v`` is an ``int``, but also that ``v >= 0``.\n\nIn a similar manner, F* allows refining computation types with\nspecifications that describe some aspects of a program's computational\nbehavior. These *effect refinements* can, in general, be defined by\nthe user in a reasoning system of their choosing, e.g., the\nrefinements may use separation logic, or they may count computation\nsteps.\n\nHowever, F* has built-in support for refining the specification of\npure programs with effect refinements that encode the standard\nreasoning principles of Floyd-Hoare Logic and weakest\nprecondition-based calculi. Foreshadowing what's about to come in this\nchapter, we can write the following specification for the\n``factorial`` function:\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Pure.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: factorial$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: factorial$\n                \nIntuitively, this type states that ``factorial x`` is a computation\ndefined only when ``x >= 0`` and always terminates returning a value\n``r >= 1``. In a way, this type is closely related to other, more\nfamiliar, types we have given to ``factorial`` so far, e.g., ``nat ->\npos``, and, indeed, ``factorial`` can be used at this type.\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Pure.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: fact$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: fact$\n\nActually, in all the code we've seen so far, what's happening under\nthe covers is that F* infers a type for a pure program similar to\n``Pure t pre post`` and then checks that that type can be subsumed to\na user-provided specification of the form ``Tot t'``.\n\nIn this chapter, we look into how these ``Pure`` specifications work,\nstarting with a primer on Floyd-Hoare Logic and weakest precondition\ncalculi. If the reader is familiar with these, they may safely skip\nthe next subsections, though even if you are an expert, if may be of\ninterest to see how such program logics can be formalized in F*.\n\n.. _Part4_Floyd_Hoare:\n\nA Primer on Floyd-Hoare Logic and Weakest Preconditions\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nFloyd-Hoare Logic is a system of specifications and rules to reason\nabout the logical properties of programs, introduced by Robert Floyd\nin a paper titled `Assigning Meaning to Programs\n<https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-011-1793-7_4>`_ and\nby Tony Hoare in `An axiomatic basis for computer programming\n<https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/363235.363259>`_. The notation used in\nmost modern presentations (called Hoare triples) is due to Hoare.  An\nalgorithm to compute Hoare triples was developed by Edsger Dijkstra\n`presented first in this paper\n<https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/ewd04xx/EWD472.PDF>`_ , using a\ntechnique called *weakest preconditions*. All of them received Turing\nAwards for their work on these and other related topics.\n\nFor an introduction to these ideas, we'll develop a small imperative\nlanguage with global variables, presenting\n\n* An operational semantics for the language, formalized as an\n  interpreter.\n\n* A Floyd-Hoare program logic proven sound with respect to the\n  operational semantics.\n\n* And, finally, an algorithm to compute weakest preconditions proved\n  sound against the Floyd-Hoare logic.\n\nOur language has the following abstract syntax:\n\n\n.. literalinclude:: ../code/Imp.fst\n   :language: fstar\n   :start-after: //SNIPPET_START: syntax$\n   :end-before: //SNIPPET_END: syntax$\n\nExpressions includes integer constants, global variables (represented\njust as natural numbers), and some other forms, e.g., arithmetic\nexpressions like addition.\n\nA program includes:\n\n* Assignments, ``EAssign x e``, representing the assignment of the\n  result of an expression ``e`` to a global variable ``x``, i.e., ``x := e``\n\n* ``Seq``, to compose programs sequentially\n\n* ``If`` to compose programs conditionally\n\n* And ``Repeat n p``, which represents a construct similar to a\n  ``for``-loop (or primitive recursion), where the program ``p`` is\n  repeated ``n`` times, where ``n`` evaluates to a non-negative\n  integer.\n\nOur language does not have ``while`` loops, whose semantics are a bit\nmore subtle to develop. We will look at a semantics\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_702d9f54d9c2ce7e29e790a65100f0c61a369e1520744f4c59211a74e195c97c_v2"}

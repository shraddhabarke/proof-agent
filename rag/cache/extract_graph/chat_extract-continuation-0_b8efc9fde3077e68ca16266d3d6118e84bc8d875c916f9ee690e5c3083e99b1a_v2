Like we did for length , can we implement an iterative version of append ,\nfactoring this ghost code on the stack into a trade?\n\nLet’s start by defining a more general version of the tail function from before. In comparison, the postcondition of tail_alt uses a universal quantifier to say, roughly, that whatever list tl' the returns y points to, it can be traded for a pointer to x that cons’s on to tl . Our previous function tail can be easily\nrecovered by instantiating tl' to tl .\n\nfn tail_alt (#t:Type) (x:llist t)\nrequires is_list x 'l ** pure (Some? x)\nreturns y:llist t\nensures exists* hd tl.\n  is_list y tl **\n  (forall* tl'. is_list y tl' @==> is_list x (hd::tl')) **\n  pure ('l == hd::tl)\n{ \n  let np = Some?.v x;\n  is_list_case_some x np;\n  with _node _tl. _;\n  let node = !np;\n  rewrite each _node as node;\n  ghost\n  fn aux (tl':list t)\n    requires pts_to np node ** is_list node.tail tl'\n    ensures is_list x (node.head::tl')\n  {\n    intro_is_list_cons x np;\n  };\n  FA.intro_forall_imp _ _ _ aux;\n  node.tail\n}\n\n\nWe’ll use these quantified trades in our invariant of append_iter ,\nshown below.
